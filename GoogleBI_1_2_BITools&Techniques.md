## Welcome to module 2

Welcome to the second section of
the Google Business Intelligence Certificate.
I'm so glad to have you joining me again.
Now that you have a solid foundation
in the basics of BI,
it's time to focus on the actual BI process.
This involves learning how to effectively engage
with stakeholders using BI tools
to make the most of available data and applying
the power of rapid monitoring
for smart business decisions.
And one thing that connects all of
these aspects of BI is asking questions.
Time and time again,
I see that the most successful people in
our field are the ones who ask lots of questions.
We ask our colleagues what's slowing them down
or causing friction in the process.
We ask about our customers,
competitors, and what's going on in a global marketplace.
We ask how things work
so we can learn about different tools and technologies.
When I was first starting out,
I would ask tons of questions about
the capabilities and limitations of
different systems, even if I didn't
use these particular tools in my own day-to-day work.
That's because just having
a basic understanding enabled me to make connections to
the work my team was doing and identify
ways that I can make positive contributions.
For instance, when I joined Google,
I was learning about Google SQL
platforms and the different
SQL languages used depending on the tools involved.
Sometimes other languages such as
Python and JavaScript were involved,
which I had never experienced before.
To familiarize myself,
I made a point to ask questions about
how these things worked and
who I could go to in order to learn more.
I encourage you to do the same thing in
your own career and even
while you pursue this certificate.
Don't hesitate to ask questions in
the discussion forums when you encounter
a topic that you want to learn more about.
There's a lot of information being covered.
In this section of the course,
we'll first explore how to successfully
collaborate with a diverse group of stakeholders.
Then you'll discover how near real-time
rapid monitoring enables users
to collect and report on key metrics,
then apply them to make better decisions.
In addition, you'll start building
some career resources by enhancing your online presence,
developing strategies for networking and mentorship,
and building a portfolio that will
impress future hiring managers.
All of that starts by understanding
an organization's business
needs and important deliverables.
After all, if you want to achieve your objectives,
you first have to define them.
Now, I've got a question for you.
Are you ready to get started? Let's go. 



# BI ANALYSTS AND ENGINEERS: THE ULTIMATE TEAM PLAYERS

## Business intelligence stakeholders

As you're discovering, BI professionals are passionate
about helping people do their jobs more effectively.
In my work, I feel a huge sense of
accomplishment when I know that
I've saved my stakeholders time,
help them find a better process,
or showed them a whole new approach.
This enables them to focus on other tasks where they
can maximize their unique strengths and interests.
But before I can do any of that,
I first have to get to know them,
their roles and responsibilities
and their business goals.
After all, different people
require different BI insights.
But once I have that understanding,
I can much more easily determine
what a particular project is all about,
and what my stakeholders are expecting me to deliver.
This is what we're going to explore now in this video.
As a quick refresher,
a stakeholder is someone who invests
time and resources into a project,
and is interested in its outcome.
Typically, this is because they need the work
you do to perform their own tasks.
But sometimes it's the other way around. You need them.
Either way, it's all about
teamwork, and that's why it's so
critical to ensure that
outputs align with the team's requirements.
Sometimes a stakeholder might be
referred to as a client or user,
but their general role is still the same.
There are all sorts of stakeholders in the BI process,
but we're going to focus on the four most common ones.
These include the project sponsor,
the systems analyst,
the developer, and the business stakeholders.
Let's start with the project sponsor.
This person has overall accountability for
a project and establishes the criteria for its success.
Accountability involves accounting for or
being responsible for project activities.
Project sponsors are representatives
of the business side,
which typically means they're
involved when a project is being
envisioned and they advocate for its undertaking.
And because the project sponsor is
responsible for sharing events,
changes and milestones with
other stakeholders in a timely and transparent manner,
it's important for BI professionals to always keep
the project sponsor informed. Here's an example.
In a previous team, I worked on an initiative that involved
the customer service department
changing its operational platform.
The project sponsor was the director of cloud systems.
She was responsible for the vision for the project,
gathering the relevant teams together,
and establishing key objectives.
As the BI professional,
I made sure to provide her with
the information she needed to support this effort,
such as what inputs I would
need and how long it would take me to create a dashboard.
The developer is the next stakeholder on our list.
Developers use programming languages to create,
execute, test, and troubleshoot software applications.
You may hear them called computer programmers,
coders, or software engineers.
There are two primary types of developers,
application software developers
and system software developers.
Apps developers design computer or mobile applications.
Because their work is largely
focused on creating for consumers.
These professionals are focused on user needs,
monitoring performance and modifying programs as needed.
System software developers are
more likely to be stakeholders on a BI project
because they develop applications and programs for
the back-end processing systems used in organizations.
Going back to my example of the customer service project,
the system software developer
worked on the platform's back-end settings,
to ensure that data flowed into data tables,
which analysts used to determine how happy
customers were with the customer service department.
Next up is the systems analyst.
This person identifies ways to design,
implement and advance information systems,
in order to ensure that they help make it
possible to achieve business goals.
Systems analysts study how
an organization uses its computer hardware and software,
cloud services, and related technologies.
Then they use what they learned
to iterate on and improve these tools.
For instance, during the customer service project,
the systems analysts worked with the raw data
provided by the system software developer.
Then they organized it into data that I, as
a BI professional, could use for reporting purposes.
Now we've come to business stakeholders.
If you're familiar with
the Google Data Analytics certificate,
then you've learned a lot about these people.
Business stakeholders invest time and resources
into a project and are interested in its outcome.
Feel free to revisit that content if you'd like
to review business stakeholders before moving on,
all of the people you learn
about in this video are different,
so they'll all require
different things from the BI process.
The key is to always communicate
proactively and prioritize teamwork.
My project was a success
because we were all in it together. 


## Know your stakeholders and their goals

Previously, you learned about the four different types of stakeholders you might encounter as a business intelligence professional: 

- Project sponsor: A person who provides support and resources for a project and is accountable for enabling its success.

- Developer: A person who uses programming languages to create, execute, test, and troubleshoot software applications. This includes application software developers and systems software developers.

- Systems analyst: A person who identifies ways to design, implement, and advance information systems in order to ensure that they help make it possible to achieve business goals.

- Business stakeholders: Business stakeholders can include one or more of the following groups of people: 

  · The executive team: The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively. The executive team might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work. 

  · The customer-facing team: The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization. 

  · The data science team: The data science team explores the data that’s already out there and finds patterns and insights that data scientists can use to uncover future trends with machine learning. This includes data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. 

Now that you’re more familiar with these different types of stakeholders, explore how they function in an actual business context. 


### The business

In this scenario, you are a BI professional working with an e-book retail company. The customer-facing team is interested in using customer data collected from the company’s e-reading app in order to better understand user reading habits, then optimize the app accordingly. They have asked you to create a system that will ingest customer data about purchases and reading time on the app so that the data is accessible to their analysts. But before you can get started, you need to understand all of your stakeholders’ needs and goals to help them achieve them.

The stakeholders and their goals

- Project sponsor:
A project sponsor is the person who provides support and resources for a project and is accountable for enabling its success. In this case, the project sponsor is the team lead for the customer-facing team. You know from your discussions with this team that they are interested in optimizing the e-reading app. In order to do so, they need a system that will deliver customer data about purchases and reading time to a database for their analysts to work with. The analysts can then use this data to gain insights about purchasing habits and reading times in order to find out what genres are most popular, how long readers are using the app, and how often they are buying new books to make recommendations to the UI design team. 

- Developers:
The developers are the people who use programming languages to create, execute, test, and troubleshoot software applications. This includes application software developers and systems software developers. If your new BI workflow includes software applications and tools, or you are going to need to create new tools, then you’ll need to collaborate with the developers. Their goal is to create and manage your business’s software tools, so they need to understand what tools you plan to use and what you need those tools to do. For this example, the developers you work with will be the ones responsible for managing the data captured on the e-reading app.

- Systems analyst:
The systems analyst identifies ways to design, implement, and advance information systems in order to ensure that they help make it possible to achieve business goals. Their primary goal is to understand how the business is using its computer hardware and software, cloud services, and related technologies, then they figure out how to improve these tools. So the system analyst will be ensuring that the data captured by the developers can be accessed internally as raw data. 

- Business stakeholders:
In addition to the customer-facing team, who is the project sponsor for this project, there may also be other business stakeholders for this project such as project managers, senior-level professionals, and other executives. These stakeholders are interested in guiding business strategy for the entire business; their goal is to continue to improve business processes, increase revenue, and reach company goals. So your work may even reach the chief technology officer! These are generally people who need bigger-picture insights that will help them make larger scale decisions as opposed to detail-oriented insights about software tools or data systems. 

_Conclusion: Often, BI projects encompass a lot of teams and stakeholders who have different goals depending on their function within the organization. Understanding their perspectives is important because it enables you to consider a variety of use cases for your BI tools. And the more useful your tools, the more impactful they will be!_


## Become an expert business intelligence communicator

Recently, we've been exploring key elements of the business intelligence process.
We spent some time getting to know typical BI
stakeholders including the project sponsor,
systems analyst, developer, and general business stakeholders.
Now we're going to take that a step further and
consider some important communication strategies that BI
professionals use when collaborating with these people.
These strategies involve knowing how to ask the right questions,
define project deliverables, and effectively share the business
intelligence you discover. No BI project is 100% clear from the very beginning, so
you'll often need to put on your detective hat. A critical part of being a BI
professional is knowing how to investigate what's currently going on
then looking for clues to better understand people's needs
and ideal project outcomes.
My colleagues and I often note that a stakeholder, partner, or coworker might say
they need one thing, but what they actually need is very different. And it's
up to us to get to the bottom of it and help them succeed. In such circumstances
having strong communication skills will enable you to dig deeper into the problem,
challenge or opportunity,
then identify how you can approach the issue in the most effective way.
This process starts with asking the right questions. If you earned the Google
Data Analytics Certificate, you spent an entire course focusing on this
ask phase of the data analysis process. As a quick refresher,
this involves understanding the difference between effective and ineffective
questions. Knowing what types of questions bring about the best insights
enables you to use questioning to fully understand stakeholder expectations,
especially when what they're asking for
is different from what your professional experience indicates they require.
If you're comfortable with the ask phase, continue to the next part of this
lesson or if you'd like to review these principles, feel free to do so now.
Okay, after asking the right questions in order to thoroughly understand
the project, it's time to define project deliverables.
A deliverable is any product, service or
outcome that must be achieved in order to complete a project.
This could be a new BI dashboard, a report,
a complete analysis, documentation of a process or decision.
Pretty much anything requested by stakeholders can be a deliverable. In BI
the most common deliverables are the dashboards and reports that provide
insights to users. When brainstorming which deliverables to produce,
it's helpful to make a list of the problems to solve, challenges to overcome,
or opportunities to maximize.
Then think about the workflow for each business process involved.
This helps you visualize the types of dashboards or
reports that will be most productive, how many are necessary, and
what specific elements each of them requires.
For example, when I'm asked to create a dashboard, I'll grab a piece of paper and
start drawing example charts in a mock up. Then I share them with the users.
This helps in two ways.
First, it ensures my vision of the dashboard is what they had in mind,
and second, it enables me to confirm for myself that it all makes sense.
Okay, now the final step: effectively sharing business intelligence. It's
important to know how to make complicated technical data more straightforward and
accessible for people who are unfamiliar with the terminology and systems involved.
Being able to present intelligence in a clear and
concise manner is fundamental to making sure that decision makers understand
the insights and can put your recommendations into practice.
Also at this point in the process an essential responsibility of every BI
professional is to consider bias. As you
likely know, bias is a conscious or subconscious preference in favor or
against a person, group of people, or thing. There are many different types
of bias that can affect a data related project, such as confirmation bias,
data bias, interpretation bias, and observer bias.
These concepts were taught in depth in the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
So please review them
now if you need to. Every project you work on must start with a focus on fairness,
which means that your work doesn't create or reinforce bias.
BI professionals have a lot of power
because we're the ones translating very technical topics into a simple language
for others.
It's vital that your translation is fair.
After all your team is trusting you. You'll continue building your
communication skills all throughout this program and
in no time you'll be ready to thoughtfully share even the most complex BI
insights. 


## Best practices for communicating with stakeholders

As you have been learning, being able to communicate effectively with stakeholders and project partners is key to your success as a business intelligence professional. This field isn’t just about building BI tools; it’s about making those tools accessible to users to empower them with the data they need to make decisions. In this reading, you will review key communication strategies and discover new best practices that will help you in the future. You will also explore the importance of fairness and avoiding bias in BI. 
Make BI accessible to stakeholders

So far, you have learned three key strategies for communication: 

    Ask the right questions 
    Define project deliverables
    Effectively share business intelligence

Sharing business intelligence can be complicated; you have to be able to simplify technical processes to make them feel straightforward and accessible to a variety of users who might not already understand the terms or concepts. Being able to present intelligence clearly and concisely is critical to making sure that stakeholders can actually use the systems you have created and act on those insights.

There are a few questions you can keep in mind to help guide your communications with stakeholders and partners:

- Who is your audience? When communicating with stakeholders and project partners, it’s important to consider who you’re working with. Consider all of the people who need to understand the BI tools and processes you build when communicating. The sales or marketing team has different goals and expertise than the data science team, for example. 

- What do they already know? Because different users have different levels of knowledge and expertise, it can be useful to consider what they already know before communicating with them. This provides a baseline for your communications and prevents you from overexplaining yourself or skipping over any information they need to know.

- What do they need to know? Different stakeholders need different kinds of information. For instance, a user might want to understand how to access and use the data or any dashboards you create, but they probably aren’t as interested in the nitty-gritty details about how the data was cleaned. 

- How can you best communicate what they need to know? After you have considered your audience, what they already know, and what they need to know, you need to choose the best way to communicate that information to them. This might be an email report, a small meeting, or a cross-team presentation with a Q&A section. 

In addition to these questions, there are a few other best practices for communicating with stakeholders. 

- Create realistic deadlines. Before you start a project, make a list of dependencies and potential roadblocks so you can assess how much extra time to give yourself when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders.

- Know your project. When you have a good understanding about why you are building a new BI tool, it can help you connect your work with larger initiatives and add meaning to the project. Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or meeting notes, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. In short, it should be easy to understand and explain the value the project is bringing to the company. 

- Communicate often. Your stakeholders will want regular updates. Keep track of key project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Another great resource to use is a changelog, which can provide a chronologically ordered list of modifications. Then, use your notes to create a report in a document that you share with your stakeholders. 
Prioritize fairness and avoid biased insights

Providing stakeholders with the data and tools they need to make informed, intelligent business decisions is what BI is all about. Part of that is making sure you are helping them make fair and inclusive decisions. Fairness in data analytics means that the analysis doesn’t create or reinforce bias (a conscious or subconscious preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing). In other words, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. 

As a BI professional, it’s your responsibility to remain as objective as possible and try to recognize the many sides of an argument before drawing conclusions. The best thing you can do for the fairness and accuracy of your data is to make sure you start with data that has been collected in the most appropriate, and objective way. Then you’ll have facts that you can pass on to your team.

A big part of your job will be putting data into context. Context is the condition in which something exists or happens; basically, this is who, what, where, when, how, and why of the data. When presenting data, you’ll want to make sure that you’re providing information that answers these questions:

    WHO collected the data?

    WHAT is it about? What does the data represent in the world and how does it relate to other data? 

    WHEN was the data collected? 

    WHERE did the data come from?

    HOW was it collected? And how was it transformed for the destination? 

    WHY was this data collected? Why is it useful or relevant to the business task?

One way to do this is by clarifying that any findings you share pertain to a specific dataset. This can help prevent unfair or inaccurate generalizations stakeholders might want to make based on your insights. For example, imagine you are analyzing a dataset of people’s favorite activities from a particular city in Canada. The dataset was collected via phone surveys made to house phone numbers during daytime business hours. Immediately there is a bias here. Not everyone has a home phone, and not everyone is home during the day. Therefore, insights from this dataset cannot be generalized to represent the opinion of the entire population of that city. More research should be done to determine the demographic make-up of these individuals.

You also have to ensure that the way you present your data—whether in the form of visualizations, dashboards, or reports—promotes fair interpretations by stakeholders. For instance, you’ve learned about using color schemes that are accessible to individuals who are colorblind. Otherwise, your insights may be difficult to understand for these stakeholders

Key takeaways:
Being able to provide stakeholders with tools that will empower them to access data whenever they need it and the knowledge they need to use those tools is important for a BI professional. Your primary goal should always be to give stakeholders fair, contextualized insights about business processes and trends. Communicating effectively is how you can make sure that happens. 



# KEEPING IT REAL: MONITOR IN THE MOMENT

## The value of near-real-time monitoring

Have you ever been shopping online
and added something to your cart,
but then ultimately decided not to purchase it?
I know I have.
I absolutely love cooking
and I like to shop online for cookbooks,
interesting spices, or maybe even a new kitchen gadget.
But sometimes I change my mind before checking
out because I choose to save the money instead,
or I decide that the kitchen tools I already
have will work just fine for my recipe.
When that happens, the online store
has what's called an abandoned cart.
According to e-commerce platform, Shopify,
online merchants lose 18 billion dollars
a year in sales revenue because of cart abandonment.
This is a big problem,
but it's one that business intelligence professionals
are very skilled at solving.
In this video, we'll consider exactly how that works.
BI professionals can use data
to identify where a customer came from,
whether a Google search,
an email link or maybe a social media post.
Then they can visualize the journey
the shopper took when visiting the website.
They're even able to pinpoint exactly where
that customer dropped off and try to figure out why.
For example, a BI professional might create a tool to
monitor how quickly the website checkout page is loading.
If the team decides that it's taking too long,
the company can dedicate resources to improve
websites speed and hopefully
keep that customer in the future.
The measure of a website page loading speed
is an example of a metric.
A metric is a single quantifiable data point
that is used to evaluate performance.
In BI some of the most important metrics are KPIs,
which you've learned are quantifiable values closely
linked to business strategy
that tracks progress towards a goal.
Many people confuse KPIs and metrics,
but they are different things.
The basic point to keep in mind is that
metrics support KPIs and in turn,
KPIs support overall business objectives.
It's also helpful to understand that KPIs are strategic,
whereas metrics are tactical.
Going back to our abandoned cart example.
Strong KPIs might be
the average value of each online transaction,
customer retention, or year over
year sales. Think of it this way.
A strategy is a plan for achieving
a goal or arriving at a desired future state.
It involves making and carrying out
plans to reach what you're trying to accomplish.
A tactic is how you get there.
It's a method used to enable an accomplishment,
including actions, events, and activities.
Tactics take place along the way as
part of your strategy to reach your final objective.
Like stepping stones between each milestone.
Reach enough milestones and you'll reach your goal.
Understanding business objectives and what is needed in
order to achieve them is the first step in BI monitoring.
BI monitoring involves building
and using hardware and software tools to
easily and rapidly analyze data and
enable stakeholders to make impactful business decisions.
Let's say our e-commerce merchants sets a goal to
decrease cart abandonment by 15% in six months.
The BI professional would create a tool that monitors
web page loading speeds
in order to help achieve that KPI.
Rapid monitoring means that the people using
BI tools are receiving live or close to live data.
In this way, key decision makers know right away
if there's a steep rise in the number of abandoned carts,
or if they run out of inventory on a popular product,
or if customer service representatives are
receiving an unusually high volume of calls.
Knowing right away means that the company can fix
whatever the problem may be as quickly as possible.
This is one of the main ways in which
BI professionals add real value to their organizations.
Later in this course,
you'll learn more about how
to select appropriate metrics.
Lots more to come. 


## How companies benefit from near-real-time intelligence

Previously, you learned how business intelligence monitoring can help businesses quickly gain insights to solve problems and create innovations ahead of the competition. This is one of the many ways BI professionals have a practical impact and add serious value to the businesses they support. In this reading, you’ll explore some actual examples of BI monitoring in the business realm. 

The WindyGrid makes real-time responses possible:

Chicago, also known as the Windy City, is a big city with millions of people. This makes allocating city resources an equally big job. The WindyGrid project monitors what is happening in the city to help officials drive municipal operations. The project contains data from multiple city departments, including 911 calls, non-emergency calls, building permits, health inspections with external data such as live weather information and tweets, and more. For example, the WindyGrid project monitors known potholes and the status of complaints filed about them. It also tracks the locations of service vehicles, such as firetrucks and ambulances, in order to respond to emergencies more quickly. 

Meal-kit company crafts individualized marketing campaigns:

A meal-kit company realized that it needed a new way to prevent overspending while implementing effective marketing campaigns. In order to do this, its BI team set up near-real-time monitoring to track marketing costs and returns. This meant team members could focus their campaigns more effectively and ensure they weren’t spending outside of their budget to do it!  

Restaurant chain unifies operations:

A restaurant chain with more than 2,000 locations had a collection of data sources that weren’t connected in a meaningful way. In order to unify operations, they implemented a BI system to centralize data about operations from locations around the world. This enabled business leaders to monitor key performance indicators and make improvements at scale across all locations.

Key takeaways:

BI monitoring provides businesses with the tools they need to rapidly analyze data and draw insights from continuously updating information. This enables more efficient and impactful decisions, as well as innovation and problem-solving. BI professionals are the key to unlocking these benefits for businesses, which is one of the reasons they’re in such high demand! As you continue through this program, you’ll learn more about BI monitoring and how to turn near-real time data into actionable insights for your stakeholders.



# CAREER FOCUS: JOINING BI FIELD

## Career focus: Let's get to (net)work

Hello, I'm Anita,
a Business Intelligence Analyst at Google.
I can't wait to help guide you

the connections you make will be an important part
of having a truly fulfilling experience.
Plus, there are also so many rewarding
in-person networking opportunities,
which we'll soon explore.
See you then! 


## Professional relationship building

Recently, you learned about the value
of maintaining a professional online presence
and connecting with others
in the business intelligence field.
As I noted,
there are many professional networking sites,
such as LinkedIn,
that are well worth your time and involvement.
But there are lots of other ways
to be proactive about your professional development.
For example,
many organizations use personal referrals when hiring.
In fact,
according to the Society for Human Resource Management,
employee referrals are the top source of external hires.
So let's start exploring how to tap into this opportunity
by building valuable relationships.
After all, the more people you connect with professionally,
the greater your chances are of being referred.
First, there are many more websites
that are wonderful ways to get to know other people
in business intelligence.
Be sure to follow best-in-class organizations
and visionary business leaders on Twitter,
Facebook, and Instagram.
Interact with them, and share their content.
If there's a post you like,
consider commenting with a response or a thank you.
You can also search
for BI webinars featuring interesting speakers,
and many of these events are free.
It can be another fascinating way to learn
while connecting with peers, colleagues, and experts.
And there are also lots of blogs and online communities
that focus on BI.
Some of the popular ones include InformationWeek's website,
Forrester's Business Intelligence Blog,
and Tableau's blog.
Next, we have in-person networking opportunities.
The easiest way to find events is by simply searching
for business intelligence events in your area.
You'll likely find meetups with posted schedules
of upcoming get-togethers,
seminars, and conferences.
Nonprofit associations are also wonderful resources,
and many offer free
or reduced-rate memberships for students.
Okay, now let's spend some time discovering
how mentorship can positively influence
your career and life.
As you may know,
a mentor is someone who shares knowledge,
skills, and experience
to help you grow both professionally and personally.
Mentors are trusted advisors,
sounding boards, and valuable resources.
The first step in finding a mentor is to figure out
what you're looking for.
Think about any challenges you face or foresee
and how to address them in order to advance professionally.
Then consider who can help you grow in these areas,
as well as fortify your existing strengths.
Share these things openly when you formally ask someone
to be your mentor.
It's also helpful to note any common experiences.
Perhaps you grew up in the same city.
Maybe you both worked in the same industry.
Your mentor doesn't have
to be someone you currently work with.
Many people find mentors on LinkedIn,
an association mentorship program,
or at a mentor-matching event.
As for me,
I found a mentor who was a business partner of mine.
I loved her leadership style,
how she interacted with her stakeholders,
and managed her team.
After working with her for quite some time,
I told her I really admired her
and asked if she'd be my mentor.
I knew she could help me develop my skills
as a people manager.
And she was happy to.
This experience really taught me the value of mentorship.
I also learned that successful mentorship requires effort
and investment in time,
whether you're preparing to ask the right questions,
internalizing the feedback,
or scheduling follow-up sessions.
But it's well worth it!
Always be open to connecting with new people.
You never know where a single conversation will lead. 


## Anita: My path to BI

Hello, I'm Anita,
a Business Intelligence Analyst at Google.
My very first job was I was a librarian
at the public library in my hometown,
and that was a job where I was talking
to people every single day.
They had questions about where to find a book,
I need something that covers X, Y, Z.
And that really helped me learn and figure out
how to talk to people who maybe have a problem
and don't know how to solve it,
but they're looking for you for help.
I think that was a huge starting point for my career in BI.
I got into BI not through a straight path.
I started off working
in accounts payable and accounts receivable,
and helping optimize those processes for my clients.
Through working with them you started to hear a lot
about the need for analytics and the need for understanding
I have so much data
but what's the important piece that comes out of this?
And so from hearing that from my clients, it started me
down this path of, okay, what tools are out there?
How can I help them find those insights?
And that led me to one job after the another
until ultimately I found myself in business intelligence.
And I can't really imagine working in any other field.
With each successive job that I've had,
whether it be as a data analyst
in accounts payable and accounts receivable
or working in a collections department.
I've picked up things
for how to tell a successful story through data.
And ultimately, I think that's a little bit
of what BI comes back to is what are the trends, patterns,
insights that we're looking for
that's gonna tell a compelling story
that let people make decisions using that information.
The one piece of advice I have
for people getting into BI is really focus
on your people skills and the networking.
The technical skills are important, the coding, the SQL,
understanding the databases
and the different programs that we use is important.
That's how you'll do your job day-to-day.
But what will really make you stand out
is how you're able to engage with your stakeholders;
how you're able to engage
with the different teams that you're working with
and how you take all of the things that you're hearing
from them and eventually synthesize them
into that final BI product that's gonna help them
get insights from their data.
I think everybody has transferrable skills.
Every job that you've had,
every experience that you've been through,
you've learned something from it.
And if you take a moment to think
about what it is that you learned from that,
maybe it's your first job in high school,
maybe it's an experience
that you had in university where working
with a group you were negotiating difficult team dynamics.
Every single one
of those is a transferrable skill that you can bring
into the business intelligence field. 


## Job-search resources for business intelligence professionals

As you continue through this course, you'll encounter resources and best practices to help you land a job as a business intelligence professional or advance your career. This reading provides you with some resources you can explore and bookmark to use on your job search.

### Job search sites

There are a lot of job search sites, and it can be difficult to find ones that are useful in your specific field. Here are a few resources designed for BI professionals:

- Built In: Built In is an online community specifically designed to connect startups and tech companies with potential employees. This is an excellent resource for finding jobs specifically in the tech industry, including BI. Built In also has hubs in some U.S. cities and resources for finding remote positions.

- Crunchboard: Crunchboard is a job board hosted by TechCrunch. TechCrunch is also the creator of CrunchBase, an open database with information about start-up companies in the tech industry. This is another valuable resource for people looking for jobs specifically in tech.

- Dice: Dice is a career marketplace specifically focused on tech professionals in the United States. It provides insights and information for people on the job search.

- DiversityJobs: DiversityJobs is a resource that hosts a job board, career and resume resources, and community events intended to help underrepresented job seekers with employers currently hiring. This resource is not tech specific and encompasses a lot of industries.

- Diversify Tech: Diversify Tech is a newsletter that is designed to connect underrepresented people with opportunities in the tech industry, including jobs. Their job board includes positions from entry-level to senior positions with companies committed to diversity and inclusion in the field.

- LinkedIn: You’ve learned about LinkedIn as a great way to start networking and building your online presence as a BI professional. LinkedIn also has a job board with postings from potential employers. It has job postings from across the world in all sorts of industries, so you’ll need to commit some time to finding the right postings for you, but this is a great place to begin your job search.

You can also search for more specific job boards depending on your needs as a job seeker and your career interests!


### Mentorships

Exploring job boards and online resources is only one part of your job-search process; it is just as important to connect with other professionals in your field, build your network, and join in the BI community. A great way to accomplish these goals is by building a relationship with a mentor. In this reading, you will learn more about mentors, the benefits of mentorship, and how to connect with potential mentors.

Considering mentorship: Mentors are professionals who share knowledge, skills, and experiences to help you grow and develop. These people can come in many different forms at different points in your career. They can be advisors, sounding boards, honest critics, resources, or all of those things. You can even have multiple mentors to gain more diverse perspectives!

There are a few things to consider along the way:

- Decide what you are searching for in a mentor. Think about your strengths and weaknesses, what challenges you have encountered, and how you would like to grow as a BI professional. Share these ideas with potential mentors who might have had similar experiences and have guidance to share.

- Consider common ground. Often you can find great mentorships with people who share interests and backgrounds with you. This could include someone who had a similar career path or even someone from your hometown.

- Respect their time. Often, mentors are busy! Make sure the person you are asking to mentor you has time to support your growth. It’s also important for you to put in the effort necessary to maintain the relationship and stay connected with them.

Note that mentors don't have to be directly related to BI. It depends on what you want to focus on with each individual. Mentors can be friends of friends, more experienced coworkers, former colleagues, or even teammates. For example, if you find a family friend who has a lot of experience in their own non-BI field, but shares a similar background as you and understands what you're trying to achieve, that person may become an invaluable mentor to you. Or, you might fortuitously meet someone at a casual work outing with whom you develop an instant rapport. Again, even if they are not in the BI field, they may be able to connect you to someone in their company or network who is in BI.

How to build the relationship:

Once you have considered what you’re looking for in a mentor and found someone with time and experience to share, you’ll need to build that relationship. Sometimes, the connection happens naturally, but usually you need to formally ask them to mentor you.

One great way to reach out is with a friendly email or a message on a professional networking website. Describe your career goals, explain how you think those goals align with their own experiences, and talk about something you admire about them professionally. Then you can suggest a coffee chat, virtual meetup, or email exchange as a first step.

Be sure to check in with yourself. It’s important that you feel like it is a natural fit and that you’re getting the mentorship you need. Mentor-mentee relationships are equal partnerships, so the more honest you are with them, the more they can help you. And remember to thank them for their time and effort!

As you get in touch with potential mentors, you might feel nervous about being a bother or taking up too much of their time. But mentorship is meaningful for mentors too. They often genuinely want to help you succeed and are invested in your growth. Your success brings them joy! Many mentors enjoy recounting their experiences and sharing their successes with you, as well. And mentors often learn a lot from their mentees. Both sides of the mentoring relationship are meaningful!

Resources:

There are a lot of great resources you can use to help you connect with potential mentors. Here are just a few:

- Mentoring websites such as Score.org, MicroMentor.org, or the Mentorship app allow you to search for mentors with specific credentials that match your needs. You can then arrange dedicated times to meet up or talk on the phone.

- Meetups, or online meetings that are usually local to your geography. Enter a search for “business intelligence meetups near me” to check out what results you get. There is usually a posted schedule for upcoming meetings so you can attend virtually. Find out more information about meetups happening around the world.

- Platforms including LinkedIn and Twitter. Use a search on either platform to find data science or data analysis hashtags to follow. Post your own questions or articles to generate responses and build connections that way.

- Webinars may showcase a panel of speakers and are usually recorded for convenient access and playback. You can see who is on a webinar panel and follow them too. Plus, a lot of webinars are free. One interesting pick is the Tableau on Tableau webinar series.

- Find out how Tableau has used Tableau in its internal departments.

- Conferences present innovative ideas and topics. The cost varies, and some are pricey. But many offer discounts to students, and some conferences like Women in Analytics aim to increase the number of under-represented groups in the field.

- Associations or societies gather members to promote a field such as business intelligence. Many memberships are free. The Cape Fear Community College Library has a list of professional associations for analytics, business intelligence, and business analysis.

- User communities and summits offer events for users of professional tools; this is a chance to learn from the best. Have you seen the Tableau community?

- Nonprofit organizations that promote the ethical use of data science and might offer events for the professional advancement of their members. The Data Science Association is one example.

_Finding and connecting with a mentor is a great way to build your network, access career opportunities, and learn from someone who has already experienced some of the challenges you’re facing in your career. Whether your mentor is a senior coworker, someone you connect with on LinkedIn, or someone from home on a similar career path, mentorship can bring you great benefits as a BI professional._


## Jerrod: The incredible value of mentorship

My name is Jerrod and I'm a principal lead in the analytics and decision support team in YouTube.
And our team focuses on building out business intelligence and analytics for
the YouTube Business Organization.
Mentorship has been a huge part of my progression in my career.
I've had the fortune of many mentors over the course
of my career both at Google and outside of Google,
some from like schooling, some just by happenstance.
But every single one of them have given me something that
was either a motivating factor or encouraged me to believe
more in myself or that like just were there to listen to me
vent about something not working or whatever it might be.
Look for groups that are focused on the areas that you're interested in.
We're thinking about BI and analytics.
There's so many groups of folks who are business intelligence professionals and
there's niche groups that are focused on data signs or predictive analytics.
I've also just reached out to people whether it is via email or
introductions from other folks that I know, LinkedIn.
And I usually tend to look for people that are doing something that
I'm interested in that have a skill that I don't have.
And I just reach out and say, hey,
I'm I'd love to have a conversation about XYZ thing and hear how you think about it.
I've actually found that LinkedIn is a really powerful tool.
It takes work, but it's a very simple entry point for networking.
And when I say networking, I don't mean just like small talk,
I mean actually reaching out to someone in the hopes that they
are someone that actually wants to be reached out to.
And really being intentional about what it is you want to learn from
people who have done something you want to do bet on yourself.
Because most likely there are not as many people who are doing the same.
But the more you show and prove your capabilities, your sticktoitiveness,
whatever other adjective you can use, the more people will start to bet on you,
and the more opportunities that come from that. 


## Wrap-up

Well, we've come to the end of another section.
You learn about enhancing your online presence,
and maximizing networking and mentorship opportunities.
You also investigated the various BI stakeholders
and some proven methods for
collaborating with them effectively.
You discovered how rapid monitoring
enables users to collect and report on key metrics,
then apply them so
organizations can make better decisions.
In addition, you learned about how metrics support KPIs,
which in turn support business objectives
and we emphasize the power that comes with a BI career,
and why it's so important to keep
fairness in mind at all times.
Your business intelligence knowledge and
skills continue to develop and grow.
I'm really happy to be with you on this exciting journey.
Coming up, you have another graded assessment ahead.
To prepare, be sure to check out the reading that
lists all of the new glossary terms you've learned.
And as always, take anytime you need to review videos,
readings, and your own
notes to refresh yourself on all the content.
Congrats on all of your progress.
We'll connect again shortly.

# REVIEW GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS CERTIFICATE CONTENT

## Stakeholders

As a data analyst, you'll be required to focus on a lot of different things and
your stakeholders, expectations are one of the most important.
We're going to talk about why stakeholder, expectations are so important to your
work and look at some examples of stakeholder needs on a project by now,
you've heard me use the term stakeholder a lot.
So let's refresh ourselves on what a stakeholder is,
stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest and
resources into the projects that you'll be working on as a data analyst.
In other words, they hold stakes in what you're doing.
There's a good chance they'll need the work you do to perform their own needs.
That's why it's so
important to make sure your work lines up with their needs and why you need to
communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across your team.
Your stakeholders will want to discuss things like the project objective,
what you need to reach that goal and any challenges or concerns you have.
This is a good thing.
These conversations help build trust and confidence in your work.
Here's an example of a project with multiple team members.
Let's explore what they might need from you at different levels to reach
the project school,
imagine you're a data analyst working with a company's human resources department.
The company has experienced an increase in its turnover rate,
which is the rate at which employees leave a company.
The company's HR department wants to know why that is and
they want you to help them figure out potential solutions.
The vice president of HR at this company is interested in identifying any
shared patterns across employees who quit and seeing if there's a connection
to employee productivity and engagement as a data analyst is your job to
focus on the HR departments question and to help find them an answer.
But the V. P.
Might be too busy to manage day to day tasks or
might not be your direct contact for this task.
You'll be updating the project manager more regularly.
Project managers are in charge of planning and executing the project.
Part of the project manager's job is keeping the project on track and
overseeing the progress of the entire team.
In most cases you'll need to give them regular updates, let them know what
you need to succeed and tell them if you have any problems along the way.
You might also be working with other team members for example,
HR administrators will need to know the metrics you're using so
that they can design ways to effectively gather employee data.
You might even be working with other data analysts who are covering different
aspects of the data.
It's so important that you know who the stakeholders and other team members are in
a project so that you can communicate with them effectively and
give them what they need to move forward in their own roles on the project.
You're all working together to give the company vital insights into this problem.
So back to our example by analyzing company data you see a decrease in
employee engagement and performance after their 1st 13 months at the company.
Which could mean that employees started feeling demotivated or
disconnected from their work and then often quit a few months later.
Another analyst who focuses on hiring data also shares that.
The company had a large increase in hiring around 18 months ago.
You communicate this information with all your team members and stakeholders and
they provide feedback on how to share this information with your VP.
In the end, your VP decides to implement an in depth manager check in with
employees who are about to hit their 12 month mark at the firm
to identify career growth opportunities,
which reduces the employee turnover starting at the 13 month mark.
This is just one example of how you might balance needs and
expectations across your team.
You'll find that in pretty much every project you work on as a data analyst,
different people on your team.
From the VP of HR to your fellow data analysts will need all your focus and
communication to carry the project to success, focusing on stakeholder.
Expectations will help you understand the goal of a project,
communicate more effectively across your team and build trust in your work
Coming up, we'll discuss how to figure out where you fit on your team and
how you can help move a project forward with focus and determination.


## Asking effective questions

Now that we've talked about six basic problem types,
it's time to start solving them.
To do that, data analysts
start by asking the right questions.
In this video, we're going to learn how to ask
effective questions that lead to
key insights you can use to solve all kinds of problems.
As a data analyst,
I ask questions constantly.
It's a huge part of the job.
If someone requests that I work on a project,
I ask questions to make sure we're on
the same page about the plan and the goals.
When I do get a result, I question it.
Is the data showing me something superficially?
Is there a conflict somewhere that needs to be resolved?
The more questions you ask,
the more you'll learn about your data and the more
powerful your insights will be at the end of the day.
Some questions are more effective than others.
Let's say you're having lunch with
a friend and they say,
"These are the best sandwiches ever, aren't they?"
Well, that question doesn't really give you
the opportunity to share your own opinion,
especially if you happen to disagree and
didn't enjoy the sandwich very much.
This is called a leading question
because it's leading you to answer in a certain way.
Or maybe you're working on a project and
you decide to interview a family member.
Say you ask your uncle,
"Did you enjoy growing up in Malaysia?"
He may reply yes,
but you haven't learned much about his experiences there.
Your question was closed ended.
That means it can be answered with a yes or no.
These kinds of questions
rarely lead to valuable insights.
What if someone asks you,
"Do you prefer chocolate or vanilla?"
What are they specifically talking about?
Ice cream, pudding, coffee flavoring or something else?
What if you like chocolate ice cream,
but vanilla in your coffee?
What if you don't like either flavor?
That's the problem with this question.
It's too vague and lacks context.
Knowing the difference between
effective and ineffective questions is
essential for your future career as a data analyst.
After all, the data analyst's process
starts with the ask phase.
So it's important that we ask the right questions.
Effective questions follow the SMART methodology.
That means they're specific, measurable,
action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound.
Let's break that down.
Specific questions are simple, significant,
and focused on a single topic
or a few closely related ideas.
This helps us collect information
that's relevant to what we're investigating.
If a question is too general,
try to narrow it down by focusing on just one element.
For example, instead of
asking a closed ended question like,
are kids getting enough physical activities these days?
Ask, what percentage of kids achieve
the recommended 60 minutes of
physical activity at least five days a week?
That question is much more specific
and can give you more useful information.
Let's talk about measurable questions.
Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed.
An example of an unmeasurable question would be,
why did our recent video go viral?
Instead, you could ask,
how many times was our video shared on
social channels the first week it was posted?
That question is measurable because it lets us
count the shares and arrive at a concrete number.
Now we've come to action oriented questions.
Action oriented questions encourage change.
You might remember that problem-solving is about seeing
the current state and figuring out how to
transform it into the ideal future state.
Well, action oriented questions help you get there.
Rather than asking,
"How can we get customers to
recycle our product packaging",
you could ask, "What design features
will make our packaging easier to recycle?"
This brings you answers you can act on.
All right. Let's move on to relevant questions.
Relevant questions matter, are important,
and have significance to
the problem you're trying to solve.
Let's say you're working on a problem related to
a threatened species of frog and you asked,
"Why does it matter the Pine Barrens tree frog
started disappearing?"
This is an irrelevant question
because the answer won't help
us find a way to prevent these frogs from going extinct.
A more relevant question would be,
what environmental factors changed in Durham,
North Carolina between 1983 and 2004 that
could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs
to disappear from the Sandhills region?
This question would give us answers we
can use to help solve our problem.
That's also a great example for
our final point, time-bound questions.
Time-bound question specify the time to be studied.
The time period we want to study is 1983-2004.
This limits the range of possibilities and enables
the data analyst to focus on relevant data.
Now that you have a general understanding
of smart questions,
there is something else that's very important to keep in
mind when crafting questions, fairness.
We've touched on fairness before,
but as a quick reminder,
fairness means ensuring that your questions
don't create or reinforce bias.
To talk about this,
let's go back to ours sandwich example.
There we had an unfair question because it
was phrased to lead you toward a certain answer.
This made it difficult to answer honestly
if you disagreed about the sandwich quality.
Another common example of
an unfair question is one that makes assumptions.
For instance, let's say
a satisfaction survey is given to
people who visit a science museum.
If the survey asks,
what do you love most about our exhibits?
This assumes that the customer loves the exhibits,
which may or may not be true.
Fairness also means crafting
questions that make sense to everyone.
It's important for questions to be clear and have
a straightforward wording that
anyone can easily understand.
Unfair questions also can make
your job as a data analyst more difficult.
They lead to unreliable feedback and missed
opportunities to gain some truly valuable insights.
You've learned a lot about
how to craft effective questions,
like how to use the SMART framework
while creating your questions,
and how to ensure that
your questions are fair and objective.
Moving forward, you'll explore different types of
data and learn how each is
used to guide business decisions.
You'll also learn more about visualizations and
how metrics or measures can help create success.
It's going to be great. 


## Bias

Let's kick things off by traveling back in time.
Well in our minds at least my real time machines in the shop.
Imagine you're back in middle school and you've entered a project for
the science fair.
You worked hard for
weeks perfecting every element and they're about to announce the winners.
You close your eyes, take a deep breath and
you hear them call your name for second place bummer.
You really wanted that first place trophy.
But hey, you'll take the ribbon for
recognition the next day you learn the judge was the winner's uncle.
How is that fair?
Can he really be expected to choose a winner fairly when his own family
member is one of the contestants, he's probably biased.
Well maybe his niece deserved to win and maybe not.
But the point is it's very easy to make a case for bias in that scenario.
Now this is a super simple example.
But the truth is we run into bias all the time in everyday life.
Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and
make quick judgments bias has evolved to become a preference in favor of or
against a person group of people or thing and it can be conscious or subconscious.
The good news is once we know and accept that we have bias,
we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it.
It's important to know that bias can also find its way into the world of data.
Data bias is a type of air that systematically skews results in a certain
direction.
Maybe the questions on a survey had a particular slant to influence answers.
Or maybe the sample group wasn't truly representative of the population being
studied.
For example, if you're going to take the median age of the US patient population
with health insurance, you wouldn't just use a sample of Medicare patients who
are 65 and older bias can also happen if a sample group lacks inclusivity.
For example, people with disabilities tend to be under identified,
underrepresented or excluded in mainstream health research.
The way you collect data can also buy us a data set.
For example, if you give people only a short time to answer questions,
the responses will be rushed when we're rushed.
We make more mistakes which can affect the quality of our data and
create biased outcomes.
As a data analyst, you have to think about bias and fairness.
From the moment you start collecting data to the time you present your conclusions.
After all those conclusions can have serious implications.
Think about this.
It's been acknowledged that clinical studies of heart
health tend to include a lot more men than women.
This has led to women failing to recognize symptoms and
ultimately having their heart conditions go undetected and untreated.
That's just one way bias can have a very real impact.
While we've come a long way in recognizing bias, it's still lead to you losing out to
the judge's niece at that science competition and
it's still influencing business decisions, health care choices and
access governmental action and more so we've still got work to do coming up.
We'll show you how to identify bias in the data itself and
explore some scenarios when you may actually benefit from it. 


## Creating a resume

Great you are back.
When you take a picture,
you usually try to capture lots of different things in one image.
Maybe you're taking a picture of the sunset and want to capture the clouds,
the tree line and the mountains.
Basically you want a snapshot of that entire moment.
You can think of building your resume in the same way you want your resume to
be a snapshot of all that you've done both in school and professionally.
In this video we'll go through the process of building a resume which you will be
able to add your own details to.
Keep in mind this is a snapshot so when managers and
recruiters look at what you've included in your resume,
they should be able to tell right away what you can offer their company.
The key here is to be brief, try to keep everything in one page and
each description to just a few bullet points, 2 to 4 bullet points is enough.
But remember to keep your bullet points concise,
sticking to one page will help you stay focused on the details that
best reflect who you are or who you want to be professionally.
One page might also be all that hiring managers and
recruiters have time to look at.
They are busy people so
you want to get their attention with your resume as quickly as possible.
Now let's talk about actually building your resume.
This is where templates come in.
They're a great way to build a brand new resume or reformat one you already have.
Programs like Microsoft Word or Google Docs and
even some job search websites all have templates you can use.
A template has placeholders for the information you'll need to enter and
its own design elements to make your resume look inviting.
You'll have a chance to explore this option a little later.
For now we'll go through the steps you can take to make your resume
professional easy to read and error free.
If you already have a resume document, you can use these steps to tweak it.
Now there's more than one way to build a resume but
most have contact information at the top of the document.
This includes your name, address, phone number and email address.
If you have multiple email addresses or
phone numbers use the ones that are most reliable and sound professional.
It's also great if you can use your first and
last name in your email address like janedoe17@email.com.
You should also make sure that your contact information matches the details
that you've included on professional websites.
And while most resumes have contact information in the same place,
it's up to you on how you organize that info,
a format that focuses more on skills and qualifications and
less on work history is great for people who have gaps in their work history.
It's also good for those who are just starting out their career or
making a career change and that might be you.
If you do want to highlight your work history, feel free to include details of
your work experience starting with your most recent job.
If you have lots of jobs that are related to a new position you're applying for
this format makes sense.
If you're editing a resume you already have you can keep it in the same format
and adjust the details.
If you're starting a new one or building a resume for
the first time choose the format that makes the most sense for you.
There's lots of resume resources online.
You should browse through a bunch of different resumes to get an idea
of the formats you think works best for you.
Once you've decided on your format you can start adding your details.
Some resumes begin with the summary but this is optional.
A summary can be helpful if you have experienced that it's not traditional for
a data analyst or if you're making a career transition.
If you decide to include a summary keep it to one or two sentences that highlight
your strengths and how you can help the company you're applying to.
You'll also want to make sure your summary includes positive words about yourself.
Like dedicated and proactive.
You can support those words with data like the number of years you've worked or
the tools you're experienced in like SQL and spreadsheets.
A summary might start off with something like hard working customer service
representative with over five years of experience.
And once you've completed this program and have your certificate you'll be able to
include that too, which could sound like this, entry level data analytics
professional recently completed the google data analytics professional certificate.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Another option is leaving a placeholder for your summary while you build the rest
of your resume and then writing it after you finish the other sections.
This way you can review the skills and experience you've mentioned and
grab two or three of the highlights to use in your summary.
