## AI tools for business intelligence

Because of the capabilities of AI, many business intelligence (BI) professionals are using it as part of their daily work. AI refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. You can use AI tools to augment and automate general work tasks, such as drafting emails and documents, summarizing information, and helping to analyze data. You can also use it to help complete specific BI tasks. For example, you might leverage AI tools to:

    Streamline data management tasks: AI tools can help increase efficiency and productivity in many business intelligence jobs. For example, you may use AI tools to help design databases, build dashboards, and improve how data is prepared for analysis. 

    Sharpen data-driven decision-making: As a BI professional, you can unlock deeper data insights by leveraging AI tools to uncover hidden opportunities, identify potential risks, and predict trends that inform better choices. 

    Improve the customer experience: As datasets grow over time, BI analysts and engineers may need to improve the usability of different systems. One way to do this is by making changes to optimize databases and avoid slowdowns. For example, in a database system that uses structured query language (SQL), you may need to update a query so it’s faster and more efficient. AI tools can provide alternative queries to help with this task.

    Present data: As a BI analyst or engineer, you may need to present your findings to different stakeholders. AI tools can help you compile high-level insights, share recommendations, and create presentations.

The ways you might use AI in your work will likely go beyond these examples as the capabilities of AI tools expand and as you continue your own development as a BI professional.

## Generative AI in business intelligence: Practical applications

You’ve been exploring ways that AI can be used in the field of business intelligence (BI), such as helping to design databases and explaining lines of code. Next, you’ll consider how you might use generative AI to complete tasks that you might be responsible for as a BI professional.

In a previous reading, you learned that AI refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. One specific type of AI is generative AI, which is AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. Gemini, ChatGPT by OpenAI, and Microsoft Copilot are examples of generative AI tools. You can interact with a generative AI tool by typing in a prompt, which is input that provides instructions to an AI tool about how to generate output. The tool then creates new content based on that prompt.

In your work as a BI professional, you can leverage generative AI tools to help you complete both practical and creative tasks. Consider these applications of generative AI tools that can help you work more efficiently and effectively:

    Create content: As its name implies, generative AI is often used to generate content. In the BI field, this might include drafting presentations for stakeholders, creating basic market research reports, and summarizing key takeaways in clear, concise language.

    Analyze information quickly: Generative AI tools can analyze large amounts of content quickly. For example, you might use generative AI to glean deeper insights about performance metrics, identify correlations between data points, and even forecast future trends.

    Answer questions in detailed and nuanced ways: Generative AI tools help you research, provide context, or supply additional information. For example, you could prompt a genAI tool to provide discoveries about large amounts of data, identify the causes of anomalies in the data, and even predict potential outcomes based on hidden patterns.

    Simplify day-to-day work: You can also use generative AI to augment routine tasks. For instance, you might use an AI tool to automatically identify and correct data errors and inconsistencies in spreadsheets, format data tables consistently, and draft emails to your team or stakeholders.

### Generative AI tools

Generative AI tools are continuously evolving, meaning BI professionals have an opportunity to regularly review and apply generative AI assistance within their processes. While building a career in this field, it may help you to explore the available generative AI tools that can assist you in your role. An example of a tool that is currently used by professionals is Tableau AI, the next generation of Tableau. Tableau AI aims to use generative AI to simplify the process of data analysis. This tool has the potential to help BI professionals deliver insights in plain language and make data-driven decisions quickly and effectively. 

Generative AI tools can be a valuable addition to your work. By combining human skills with these tools, BI professionals can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data and unlock deeper insights.

## ACTIVITY: Use AI to write a project requirements document

In this activity, you'll ask a generative AI tool to provide more information about a Project Requirements Document. A Project Requirements Document contains details like the purpose of the project and stakeholder requirements. 

### Scenario

You're a BI analyst at a large national restaurant chain. The company has experienced an extended period of strong performance, so the executive leadership team wants to expand the company’s operations to several new cities. The team asks you to create a Project Requirements Document for this project, but it’s been a long time since you created one. You email your manager to ask for examples of what one should look like. In the meantime, you decide to use a genAI tool to try to find more information about what this document is used for and what sections it should contain.

In this activity, you will use a browser-based generative AI tool, such as Gemini, ChatGPT, or Microsoft Copilot. Instructions in this activity will refer to Gemini, but you can use the generative AI tool of your choice.

The following template and supporting materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed to the next steps.

    Please don’t enter private or confidential information in your Gemini conversations or any data you wouldn’t want Google to use to improve its products, services, and machine learning technologies.

### Prompt

A prompt is input that provides instructions to an AI tool about how to generate output. You can prompt Gemini using text or speech and can phrase your prompts in a variety of ways. Your prompt should provide clear and specific instructions that will guide the tool towards generating a targeted response.  

To get started, type this prompt or something similar into Gemini: 

     What is a project requirements document? What sections should it contain?

Then type or copy and paste your prompt into the Prompt section of the Prompt an AI tool template. 

Copy and paste Gemini’s output into the Output section of the template. Sometimes Gemini offers multiple responses. Choose the one that most closely meets your needs. 

Then, carefully review the output to ensure it is factually correct, specific, and detailed enough for your document. As you review the output, consider the following questions:

    Is the output accurate? 

    Is the output unbiased? 

    Does the output include the information I need?

    Is the output relevant to my project or task?

    Is the output consistent if I use the same prompt multiple times?

Reflect on the ways in which the output meets your goals and how it could better meet your needs. For example, perhaps the output is very concise and you would like it to be more detailed. 

Then, in the Notes section of the template, list at least two ways that the output could better meet your needs.

Working to refine your prompts and provide more context can help the generative AI tool produce clearer, more specific, and more useful information. Think of this process as having a conversation with someone, where they tell you something and then you respond by asking for more information or context. Engaging in a back-and-forth dialogue with generative AI tools can lead to more personalized and effective output. And issuing follow-up requests can help produce content that better aligns with your needs.

Review the guidelines in the Prompt engineering best practices

 document and refer to the notes you listed in Step 4 about how Gemini’s output could better meet your needs. Then, review the following examples, which demonstrate how a prompt could be iterated upon to produce a more useful output, and implement at least two of these best practices to add follow-up requests to your original prompt: 

    Add a verb. It's helpful to include a verb in your prompt to produce useful output for your intended task. Using a verb like “list” or “outline” would give you a different output.

        For example: Outline the sections I should include when writing a Project Requirements Document.

    Add context. Supply more information about the task to help the tool provide better results. 

        For example: Include information pertaining to a restaurant chain in the document. 

    Add a specific goal. Include the final goal or specify the outcome that you need. 

        For example: Show what the document should include for a restaurant chain wanting to expand to other cities. 

    Reflect on whether you should format your results. Give specific instructions for how to return the output, such as in a bulleted list or ordered by the way they should be in the document.

        For example: Provide the response in a bulleted list and prioritize the sections in the order they should be listed in the document.

    Provide a persona. Ask the AI tool to take on the persona of a business intelligence analyst or another professional in the field. Giving the tool a persona may help it provide examples—such as the specific business problem or opportunity the project aims to address—within the context of your prompt.

        For example: Answer as if you are a business intelligence analyst.

    Specify the tone or audience. Ask the AI tool to tailor its response to a specific audience. You might consider audiences you don’t often interact with, such as senior stakeholders or other relevant audiences.

        For example: Update the response so it would appeal to the executive leadership team.

    Supply examples. Demonstrate the kind of output you’re hoping for. 

        For example: In the stakeholder requirements section, prioritize the requirements. For example, create a table with labels for required, desired, or nice-to-have. 

    Specify length. Ask for a short or long output to give the tool an idea of the desired length of the response. 

        For example: There should be no more than 10 pages in this document.

Reflect on the ways in which the iterated output meets your goals. The objective is not to get the perfect output, but to get enough information for you to work with. Be sure to always check your output before using it. 

In the Observations section of the template, list at least two ways that you iterated on your prompt with follow-up requests and describe how those iterations made the output meet your goals more closely.
