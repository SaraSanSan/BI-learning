# DATA MODELS & PIPELINES

You’ll start this course by exploring data modeling, common schemas, and database elements. You’ll consider how business needs determine the kinds of database systems that BI professionals implement. Then, you’ll discover pipelines and ETL processes, which are tools that move data and ensure that it’s accessible and useful.

Learning Objectives:

    Identify and define key database models and schemas.
    Assess which database design pattern and schema is appropriate for different data.
    Discuss data model alternatives that would be optimal, performant, and adherent to the reporting requirements looking into current data size and growth.
    Define ETL and explain what it means.
    Identify key information from stakeholders necessary to create a data pipeline.
    Describe different types of pipelines.
    Describe the key stages of a data pipeline.
    Understand what a data pipeline is, its objectives, and how it works.
