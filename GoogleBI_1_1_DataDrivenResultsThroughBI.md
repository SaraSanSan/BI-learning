# GET STARTED WITH BI

## Welcome to the Google Business Intelligence Certificate

Our world is constantly shifting and transforming.
Companies everywhere are working to lead the way
to the next big thing,
and consumers expect rapid, exciting product launches
and packages that are delivered
to their doorsteps like magic.
With all of this incredible change,
the value of speed has become immeasurable.
It's truly one of the most important factors
of business success today.
After all, the ability
to identify an issue or opportunity is great,
but real value is achieved when you identify that issue
before it becomes a huge problem,
or act upon that opportunity ahead of the competition.
These days, there's more data about
marketplaces, organizations,
customers, competitors, and employees than ever before,
but we need more than data alone
to make better decisions and deliver rapid results.
And that's where intelligence comes in...
business intelligence.
Business intelligence, or BI,
involves automating processes and information channels
in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights
that are easily available to decision-makers.
In other words, by showing decision-makers
what is currently happening,
organizations become more intelligent and successful.
A national restaurant group might analyze
millions of customer receipts
to optimize its food supply and reduce waste,
or a local hospital could integrate
numerous different data sources
to review feedback and outcomes
in order to help personalize the patient experience,
or perhaps a global manufacturing company
uses supply chain data from around the world
to make more precise demand forecasts
and ensure appropriate inventory levels.
The BI applications are endless,
and so are the BI career opportunities.
The field involves such diverse organizations and industries,
that wherever your interest may be,
there's a path for you.
In this program alone, you'll learn about
everything from appliance manufacturers to grocery stores
to local artisans to artificial intelligence companies.
BI professionals are making an impact everywhere.

## Google Business Intelligence Certificate overview

Hello, and welcome to the Google Business Intelligence Certificate! In this program, you will explore the growing field of business intelligence (BI), learn how BI is crucial to organizations and the people they serve, and develop the relevant skills for a future career in the field. By completing the three courses in this certificate program, you'll prepare for entry-level positions in BI. No prior BI experience is required to complete the program, but a foundational background in data analytics is strongly encouraged.

### Enter a growing field

Companies report the largest skills gap in data analytics, and the demand for data analytics skills is growing over 15 times faster than the demand for the average skill in the US. Every business process, in organizations of all types and sizes, generates huge volumes of data. This data may be stored in different locations and formats that are difficult to access and don’t provide useful insights. To use that data to effectively inform business decisions, it needs to be retrieved, structured, interpreted, and reported in usable formats that enable stakeholders to understand and act. BI professionals play an extremely important role in this process: They manage data retrieval; organize data; interpret data in different ways to fit the problem at hand; and create data visualizations, dashboards, and other tools to provide stakeholder-ready insights.

Throughout this program, you will have multiple opportunities to develop your BI knowledge and skills. You will explore concepts and scenarios to learn what an entry-level BI professional must know and be able to accomplish to thrive in the field.

### Google Business Intelligence Certificate courses

The Google Business Intelligence Certificate has three courses.

## Sally: Personal career journey

Hi, I'm Sally.
I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst at Google.
What that means is,
I work with data to help improve the hiring experience at Google.
The way in which I entered data analytics is via a business boot camp that I did
years ago. I was thinking of becoming biomedical researcher
and this is something I just wanted to use during extra time that I had.
We learned about just data analysis in general and
I found that I had like a knack for it.
Everything just made sense.
It was very tangible.
You can see the results pretty immediately and you could search for things.
I love puzzles, so trying to find using different clues and
trying to find what is the answer.
And I really enjoyed it as well as enjoyed working with teams,
which is different from when I was in the sciences.
It was very much independent, I was doing my own thing.
But within the business boot camp, I was working within a group of people and
that was so social and so much fun.
And we were supporting each other and I love that, that team environment.
Through the program is how I got my first job.
There was someone I met on the program who graduated a year before me.
And when it was time for me to apply for jobs, he had an opening on his team and
he reached out to me to see if I wanted to apply.
So that's actually how I got into data analytics.
I didn't study data analytics.
I had to teach myself everything from, I had to teach myself SQL.
I didn't feel like I was really contributing or
that I had any security in this field.
And so what I tried to do is I try to teach myself python, go
into machine learning, and what not.
But ultimately, what I found is, I don't need to do that.
I just need to find a niche - what I'm good at - and develop that and
become an expert in that.
So the advice that I would give for
someone who's trying to enter the field of business intelligence,
is to consider the difference between data analytics and business intelligence.
I personally found that I really like SQL.
Love SQL on the technical side of things.
In addition to that, so I wanted to level up and enter business intelligence.
You can make your career within the broader field of data analytics be
whatever you want, depending on what it is that you enjoy.

# THE ORGANIZATIONS AND TEAMS THAT BENEFIT FROM BI


## Explore business intelligence careers

We often hear about all of
the data that's created each and every day.
It could be something as simple as taking
a photo with your phone or paying your bills,
or something as complex as a global company launching
a new product or running
a multimedia advertising campaign.
It really feels like practically everything creates data.
So it's no wonder that organizations need
experts to help them access the right data,
use it to find ways to grow and
improve, and put those insights into action.
In fact, as the volume of data is ever
escalating so is a need for
professionals who can make that data shine.
For instance, in my role,
I'm proud to be able to use data to
give my stakeholders a quick overview
of exactly what they need to
know without getting lost in the details.
The tools I create enable them
to clearly evaluate the candidate
hiring and employee experiences
within Google's People Operations.
One way this works is by showing my stakeholders how long
the interview journey is when
someone is being hired at Google.
This is important because it
helps them determine if we need to hire
more recruiters or interview schedulers
in order to improve the process for our candidates.
In this video, you'll learn more
about how those of us in BI offer
value to our colleagues and how we help
shape the future of our organizations.
There are so many different potential roles to explore.
For example, in this program,
you'll learn a lot about BI analysts and BI engineers.
BI analysts gather requirements from stakeholders,
partners, and team members.
They use their understanding of
large datasets to retrieve,
organize, and interpret data.
Then they create visualizations, dashboards,
and reports to use when
presenting and communicating insights to others.
The intelligence they share
might be used to make decisions,
develop a new process,
or create a business strategy,
or it could be applied to even deeper analysis.
BI engineers are responsible for designing,
configuring, implementing,
and improving data tools and processes.
They evaluate and streamline various devices,
infrastructures, and
information channels called pipelines.
Engineers are excellent troubleshooters and
help find solutions to security issues,
application permissions and updates,
and other technical challenges.
In other words, a BI engineer
manages tools and processes,
which enables a BI analyst
to put those tools and processes to work.
However, it's also important to note
that some companies don't distinguish
between those two BI jobs, using
the terms analyst and engineer interchangeably.
So when you begin to explore job opportunities,
be sure to spend some time researching the job and
organization in order to
fully understand what's involved.
No matter which path you ultimately choose,
a career in BI has a potential to be amazing.
Research shows that all industries
today need skilled BI professionals.
But there are not enough people with
the right experience and talent to satisfy this demand.
BI professionals enjoy strong career prospects.
In fact, a quick search for job openings in the industry
reveals thousands of opportunities on LinkedIn alone.
But perhaps best of all,
BI professionals find the work
rewarding and fulfilling because
we know what we do makes someone else's life better.
Coming up and throughout this program,
you'll discover some really inspiring examples of
just how BI makes such a positive impact.
I can't wait to share them with you. 


## Business intelligence drives change - PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

As you have been learning, a business’s ability to identify issues before they become problems or act on opportunities before their competition is key to intelligent decision-making. Now more than ever, we have access to data about our marketplace, organizations, customers, competitors, and employees. But in order to turn that data into rapid results, we need business intelligence. Business intelligence involves automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers. 

In this reading, you’re going to explore two examples of how BI has helped real businesses gain insights, access the right data, and find ways to grow and improve their processes to put those insights to work. 

Key takeaways:

No matter what industry you’re working in, BI can automate processes and information channels to empower the people who need that data to answer questions and make decisions. From restaurants reducing waste to hospitals advancing patient care, BI analysts create systems and tools to anticipate needs and enable organizations to reach their objectives. 

### Restaurants reducing waste 
    
    Two customers at a restaurant using a tablet to order while worker watches
    
    Consider a fictitious scenario about a fast-food restaurant chain. Leaders at this company have huge amounts of data to manage, such as: customer transactions, marketing data related to promotions, customer satisfaction, employee information.
    
    And so much more! But on top of all of that, the company also has to consider the logistics for individual restaurants. That’s where the problem comes in.
    
    The problem:
    
    The restaurants need to have ingredients to cook and serve customers, but if they have too much, that extra stock often goes to waste. 
    
    Company leadership consults with their BI team to consider how to approach two concerns: How to ensure the restaurants’ numerous locations have enough ingredients to meet customer demand; and how to reduce food waste
    
    However, these stakeholders currently don’t have metrics in place to specifically measure food waste or strategies to reduce it. This is exactly where the BI team will need to start.
    
    The solution:
    
    In order to address the stakeholder’s needs, the BI team spends time gathering information about current metrics and processes. They first use this information to determine what data they have and how it’s being used. 
    
    They discover that there are already useful metrics being applied in other ways by various teams in the company, including: How many ingredients are delivered to each location; How much of each menu item is made each day; How much of each menu item is actually being ordered each day.
    
    By comparing these existing metrics, the company can better understand how much food is going to waste. Thus, the BI analysts are able to gather the necessary information on incoming food delivery, customer orders, and food consumption in the form of a dashboard for stakeholders to monitor food waste. The BI analysts then organize this data within the database systems and deliver it to new tables that report the results for stakeholders to consider as they strategize how to reduce food waste. 
    
    The results:
    
    Knowing how much food is actually going to waste now enables stakeholders to better achieve their goals. The restaurant chain discovers that the largest source of food waste is the French fries. Across their locations, 10–20% of French fries are left over at the end of the month. With this information, the company’s central operations team sends out a memo to all branches recommending they reduce their incoming French fry delivery by 10%. In this way, the BI analysts are able to help the business identify an area for improvement and reduce waste. 


### Hospitals promoting patient care

    A patient looking at a doctor with a tablet
    
    Hospitals also have to manage a lot of different kinds of data — especially patient information. They also have a variety of data sources that they need to access and share to ensure that other connected users — such as doctors working outside of the hospital — can get patients the treatment they need without wasting time or resources. 
    
    The problem:
    
    For this scenario, consider a hospital system that’s challenged to communicate effectively with doctors who don’t work within the same hospital system. Administrators have noticed that this creates a few different problems: Doctors outside of the system can’t access test results from the hospital; Patients are being tested multiple times.
    
    This is expensive and inefficient, both for the hospital and patients. So, decision-makers choose to work with a team of BI specialists to create database systems that get data in the hands of doctors who need it. 
    
    The solution:
    
    Basically, this hospital system is experiencing a problem related to inaccessible patient data. There is a lot of data streaming in from multiple source systems that needs to be consolidated into one destination that can be used by doctors, including information about: Previous visits; Tests; Allergies.
    
    And other relevant medical information. So, the BI team develops a pipeline system that ingests data from all key sources, processes and transforms it so that it is consistent, and delivers it to a database system where doctors are able to access all the information they need.
    
    The results:
    
    By streamlining the hospital’s many data sources into one consolidated database, the BI team helps save the hospital money and resources by eliminating duplicate tests. Now, doctors are better able to treat patients, patients save money on redundant tests and procedures, and the hospital can run more efficiently. This is all thanks to the tools built by the BI team!

## BI TEAMS AND PARTNERS

What do you do when you're facing a really challenging task or big problem?
You've done your research, tried multiple approaches, but
nothing seems to be working.
It's natural to be frustrated.
We've all been there.
But a much better strategy is to simply ask for help.
As the saying goes, two heads are better than one.
And in business complex problems often require 5,
10, or even hundreds of people coming up with potential solutions.
This is why business intelligence professionals collaborate with lots of
different team members in their work. Brainstorming and building together,
pulling knowledge, and working out issues is essential to the BI
process. BI professionals also rely on team members to provide important
inputs for their projects and to partner on solutions.
This video will share examples of the key players you might work with.
Keep in mind every organization handles job titles differently, so you may
encounter some discrepancies or overlap, but this is a great place to start.
First up, API professionals. API stands for application programming interface.
This is a set of functions and procedures that integrate computer programs
forming a connection that enables them to communicate.
There are so many different roles that involve
APIs.
Including
API strategists, developer, engineer, and
product owner.
When you're working in business intelligence, you might collaborate with
API professionals in order to create the interface that you need for a particular
project, especially if some of your data is coming from a third party platform.
APIs bring that data into the internal company database in order to build
reporting tools and dashboards.
API professionals code in a number of different computing languages
including Python, Java, and so many others.
So it's up to API partners to write code that's specific to each project and
business need.
You may work with data warehousing specialists who develop processes and
procedures to effectively store and organize data.
These people also help ensure BI professionals can easily access the data
they need.
There are also data governance professionals.
These team members are responsible for
the formal management of an organization's data assets.
This may involve managing the availability,
integrity, and security of data based on internal standards and policies.
This is very important for making sure data is trustworthy and
doesn't get misused or corrupted.
Of course data analysts are key partners as they collect, transform and
organize data.
They are dataset specialists reviewing and validating the data all the time.
They also identify and implement exciting new analysis methodologies.
Another key team
is IT.
Information technology professionals test install, repair, upgrade, and maintain
the hardware and software solutions that organizations use every single day.
BI professionals work with the
IT department in order to maximize all of
the available data and data tools.
In addition, project managers are key collaborators, as they handle the
day-to-day project steps, scope, schedule, budget, resources, and much more.
There are all kinds of contributors and every organization is different. Who you
work with will depend on the size of the company, the available tools, and
the nature of the work.
For example, if your project deals with the customer experience,
then the customer success team will be essential to providing inputs.
If your project is about employee engagement,
then you'll work closely with the HR team.
And because my work involves hiring processes, I really benefit from
collaborating with the recruiting team members here at Google.
Now, there is another essential group of people on the team and
that's your stakeholders. In an upcoming
section in this course,
we'll talk lots more about the various stakeholder roles as they relate to BI.
We'll also explore different stakeholder goals and how you can use your
BI skills to reach them. Stay tuned. 

## Collaboration with business intelligence partners

Previously, you learned about the many different partners a business intelligence professional might team up with to create systems and tools for an organization to improve processes and provide stakeholders with ongoing insights. These partners could include:

    API professionals

    Data warehousing specialists

    Data governance professionals

    Data analysts

    IT professionals

    Project managers

    And many more!

Complex business problems require collaboration and cross-team cooperation. These partners have unique knowledge, experience, skills, and perspectives to bring to the table. Brainstorming and building together, pooling knowledge, and fleshing out issues is essential to the BI process. 

Tackling complex problems is related to a concept you might already be familiar with if you completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate: structured thinking. Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. Basically, structured thinking allows you to break a problem down into manageable pieces. 

The same is true for BI. Often, you have a complex problem with a lot of pieces to consider; by using a structured approach and breaking down the problem to manageable pieces, the process to solve the issue and get results is much easier. And your partners in the organization are a great resource along the way. 

Now, let’s explore some examples of BI professionals collaborating with their partners to solve problems and provide insights to stakeholders that empower decision-making. 
Managing membership data

The marketing team for a retail store was looking for ways to increase memberships for its loyalty program. Leaders wanted to encourage repeat customers to enroll. However, they didn’t have a system in place that allows analysts to explore both member and nonmember sales data. This requires ingesting data from a variety of systems, including the store’s online membership form and sales data. So, in addition to building a tool that moves and transforms key data, the BI team also needed to make the data from different systems align with the destination system. 

In this case, they collaborated with several teams:

    The marketing team: The marketing team was the primary stakeholder for this initiative. They worked with the BI team to determine project requirements, timelines, and deliverables.

    The API team: Next, the BI team collaborated with the API professionals in order to integrate the data into the internal company database. The API team also helped build the reporting tools and dashboards. 

    Data warehousing specialists: Then they teamed up with data warehousing specialists to create a storage and organization system for the newly acquired data. 

In the end, the marketing team was empowered with a system that allowed them to access the data they needed to explore customer trends and strategize ways to increase membership for their loyalty program. 
Securing sensitive data

Another BI professional was working at a tech company that creates health-monitoring tools such as smart watches. The data analysts on their team were interested in exploring user data to find out how customers are using their products. Because some personally identifiable information was included, it was critical that all data be anonymized and secured. 

The BI team partnered with the data warehousing specialists and data governance team in order to make sure that the storage systems protected the users while allowing data analysts to draw insights. In the end, the data analysts were able to use the smart watch data to explore trends and provide insights while still maintaining the privacy of users.  
Key takeaways

Collaborating with the people on your team who have different skills and perspectives is an important part of a structured approach to BI. As a BI professional, you will collaborate with a variety of partners to create systems that empower stakeholders with data to advance and succeed. 


# BI STRUCTURES AND STAGES

## Business intelligence maximizes the value of data analytics

With business intelligence and
data analytics gaining so much popularity these days,
the term business intelligence and
data analytics are often defined incorrectly,
oversimplified, or used
interchangeably for speedy communication.
That can lead to confusion because
BI and DA are quite different.
In this video, we're going to sort that out.
First, let's establish that both BI and DA
professionals enable
data-driven decision-making in their organizations.
They're also both a key part
of their company's data maturity.
Data maturity is the extent
to which an organization is able to
effectively use its data in
order to extract actionable insights.
Whether that data includes
information about your customers,
staff, products, suppliers, finances, or something else,
it's worthless if it can't be put to work.
Putting data to work requires
skilled professionals who can apply
techniques and technologies to
achieve high levels of maturity.
In this effort, data analysts are primarily
involved with using data to
answer questions about what happened.
On the other hand, BI professionals
aim to achieve higher levels of
data maturity by building data
reporting tools such as dashboards.
Dashboards continuously analyze and monitor data.
The work isn't complete just
because the tool has been created.
The analysis and monitoring are
ongoing. This is because BI involves
establishing repeatable methods to understand how things
are operating and by knowing the current state,
company leaders can take
action to improve the future state.
For example, a BI professional might
investigate what new sales prospects
are being targeted today.
How many customers have we gained this month?
Or did our weekly email perform
well with new subscribers?
Because BI is all about near-real-time rapid monitoring,
BI insights are most effective
when they make an impact right now.
Therefore, the people who use
the reporting tools wants to make
sure they are practical and efficient.
BI professionals are expert tool builders.
Then it's typically the data analysts
who apply these tools in order to answer
a question or solve a problem by
examining the data through a specific topic or lens.
Again, a big part of BI is creating dashboards that
provide users with clear snapshots of the current state.
These tools must be impactful and easy to interpret.
Even for non-technical people.
If you like thinking about what you can
create that meets the needs of many different users,
BI will let you do just that.
BI professionals generally work on
large scale projects that are
helpful for multiple stakeholders.
Also, as you consider how you will fit in the BI world,
note that BI professionals are experts in
data infrastructure and enjoy
the technical side of data analytics.
For instance, if you love working
with databases, big data,
and the computer programming language SQL,
BI will give you the opportunity
to take your queries to the next level.
If you earned the Google Data Analytics certificate,
the content included there formed
your foundational knowledge and experience.
Now, this BI program will provide
a complimentary skill set
that builds on those foundations.
It will also add a lot of
very marketable talents to your resume that will create
a compelling combination of skills for employers to
consider and will open
the doors for more job opportunities.
In addition to the technical side of
things such as managing large datasets,
writing queries in SQL, and creating dashboards.
You'll learn some really worthwhile professional skills.
These include: the ability to juggle
many different priorities, attention to detail,
owning a process, communicating with others,
and learning how to go beyond surface level requests.
Perhaps most importantly,
you'll discover the value of connecting with
others to really drive results and that's how
you build a career rather than just have a job.
In future lessons, you will continue to explore
the similarities and differences between BI and DA.
The two disciplines complement and rely on each other.
Just like the talented people who work in these roles.
Together, they help their organizations
advance on the data maturity scale every day. 

## Compare data analysis and business intelligence

If you earned the Google Data Analytics Certificate or have experience working with data, you probably know that data analytics and business intelligence have both similarities and differences. In many ways, BI builds on tasks that data analysts perform. Often, data analysts are the stakeholders for whom BI professionals develop systems. In this reading, you’ll compare and contrast DA and BI to explore more about these similarities and differences.

Data tasks  /  DA  /  BI

Involvement
	
    The first step of the data analysis cycle is to define the business problem and establish stakeholder expectations.
	In addition to defining business problems and asking questions to establish expectations, BI professionals observe current processes to determine how they can be improved to align more with stakeholder needs.

Answering questions
	
    Data analysts are often tasked with deciding what data they need to answer their stakeholders’ questions and gathering that data for use.
	BI professionals evaluate the data needs of their stakeholders, identify necessary sources, and design pipeline systems that automatically and continuously gather that data for stakeholders to access.

Gathering data
	
    Once data has been gathered, data analysts must ensure that it is clean and ready for use. They also perform transformations on the data to prepare it for analysis.
	BI professionals build tools that clean and transform data automatically within a pipeline so that these processes occur to all data being ingested by the pipeline process.

Storage systems
	
    Data analysts must adhere to organization conventions and store historical data for analysis.
	BI professionals develop storage systems that allow intake from multiple source systems into a destination database, while governing the database schema and optimizing the system.

Descriptive and predictive analytics

    Data analysis focuses on descriptive analysis that describes historical trends.
	BI uses analysis of historical trends to perform predictive analytics that enable organizations to determine likely future trends and act accordingly.

Presenting insights
	
    After analysis, data analysts present their findings to inform the stakeholders’ ultimate decision.
	BI analysts create tables, reports, and dashboards that empower stakeholders with access to the data they need to inform their whole decision-making process.

Iteration

    After the initial analysis, data analysts may repeat their analysis based on their findings or new information.
	BI analysts continue to iterate on processes to improve and optimize the systems and tools they have built to ensure they continue to be useful for stakeholders.

_DA and BI share a lot of common ground: They are both fields in which professionals use data to create insights that inform decision-making. But BI is more focused on creating processes and information channels that transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers on a continual basis._

## The stages of business intelligence

If you earned your Google Data Analytics certificate,
then you're very familiar with
the data life cycle and the data analysis process.
Data analysts use these phases
in their work every single day
in order to gain insights that
lead to informed decision-making.
As a quick refresher,
the data life cycle is a sequence of
stages that data experiences,
which include plan, capture,
manage, analyze, archive, and destroy.
The data analysis process occurs in six phases.
Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
Business intelligence also has phases,
a sequence of three stages
that determines the value of BI,
as well as organizational data maturity.
As you've learned, data maturity is
a meaningful goal for any BI team because
high maturity means their organization is
effectively using its data in order
to extract actionable insights.
In BI, the three stages are
capture, analyze, and monitor.
As you advance through each one,
the process requires a deeper level of
exploration and investigation,
so each becomes more complex.
These phases might be automated or done manually,
but each one adds significant business impact,
which is well worth the effort.
It's important to understand these stages and
how they can benefit you as a BI professional.
We're going to explore each one of them in this video.
Let's start with capture,
which is the "what happened" point in the BI process.
This stage pertains
to static backward-looking data. For instance,
if you were to query a database to return a data set
about what your customers purchased last month,
that's an example of capturing information. Or you
might access a spreadsheet that lists
profits and losses from the previous quarter.
That's also an example of
capturing or record of certain information.
Records are essential to BI,
but they don't enable users to easily
investigate in depth and really dig into the data,
and that hinders the insights they're able to provide.
Also, because of data in this stage
is rigid and backward-looking,
it's not always very useful
for proactive forward-looking decisions.
Capturing information is a necessary element of BI,
but information alone doesn't
let us know what's working well,
how we can improve or what to do next.
However, in the following step,
things get better.
Which brings me to Stage 2:
analyze. The "why did it happen" part of BI.
You already know a lot about this stage,
but as a quick reminder,
data analysis is when we draw conclusions,
make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
Because the analyze stage explores why things happen,
it's much more likely to result in
effective plans and strategies.
In this way, it enables BI professionals to
better understand key relationships between data points.
They do this by examining data more deeply, more broadly,
or even side-by-side, in order to identify
connections that at first might not have been apparent.
Now we've come to the final part of
the process: monitor.
Monitor is the "what's happening now" stage,
and here's where BI professionals
really get to show off their unique skills and expertise.
In this stage, you use
automated processes and information channels,
such as data models,
ETL pipelines, dashboards and more.
These exciting tools take
the data that organizations create
every single day and transform it into
true intelligence that is
easily available to stakeholders.
These BI tools reveal upswing,
downturns, changes,
challenges, opportunities, and much more.
Decision-makers then use the insights these tools
deliver in order to
proactively work towards business goals.
You'll learn all about
these BI tools in upcoming courses,
and soon in this course,
I'll provide some foundational information
about the BI professional's toolbox.
You can use it to start familiarizing
yourself with what happens during the monitor stage.
For now, great job on
all the progress you've made so far.
I'm so happy to be sharing the world of BI with you.
Let's keep it up and head to the next lesson. 


# HOW BI MAKES AN IMPACT

## Contribute to a winning business intelligence strategy

Strategy is a big part of life in so many ways.
Take the planet's most popular sport, football or soccer.
The rules and gameplay are relatively simple, but
the strategy is extremely complex.
Depending on who's on the field and their particular skills,
the coaches must choose between many different formations and tactics.
And no matter how talented a player may be, they'll only perform their best
if they have a solid understanding of football strategy such as being able
to identify the precise moment to shoot or want to pass instead.
The game of chess is also all about strategy.
Each piece has a distinctive way of moving such as a rook shifting horizontally or
vertically across the board, a knight jumping over other pieces or
the powerful queen going pretty much anywhere she wants.
Mathematicians have actually proven that there are more potential chess
game variations than atoms in the universe.
And with so many possible outcomes,
having a clear strategy is absolutely essential to creating a winning game plan.
Well, creating a winning strategy is also a big part of BI.
You may recall learning about data strategy,
which is the management of the people, processes, and tools using data analysis.
Similarly, business intelligence strategy is the management of the people,
processes, and tools used in the business intelligence process.
As you're discovering, BI is complex and
it requires a 360 degree view of the organization.
Thoughtful preparation to effective strategy is a must.
In this video, we'll explore how that works.
Let's start with people.
The most important thing here is to make sure people are working together
in a positive way.
Sometimes several departments in the company are using BI, but
the processes are siloed, meaning they lack communication and collaboration.
Maybe the sales team doesn't have access to important marketing data or
human resources is tracking valuable employee data, but only for
their own internal purposes.
So the first thing to do is simply communicate with all of the team members
and stakeholders who are involved.
Include people from all levels of the organization so
you get many diverse perspectives.
Begin by asking them some key questions such as, are our BI teams and
professionals coordinated?
Is there any overlap among their functions?
Who should be responsible for establishing the rules and
policies that govern BI processes?
Note that BI governance involves defining and implementing BI systems and
frameworks within an organization.
This is different from the concept of data governance which you may know is a process
for ensuring the formal management of a company's data assets.
Now most importantly in the people step, be sure to ask about the vision for
the BI process.
And how does that vision align with current business strategy?
A vision specifies your desired outcomes such as winning the football game or
chess match.
The second element of BI strategy is process.
By now, you've established who will be responsible for the rules and
policies that govern BI processes.
So some questions to ask these people include,
what solutions are we using and how?
Which of them bring value?
What types of solutions do we plan to implement?
How will we deliver them?
How will we support them?
In addition,
having a user support framework is a critical part of the process.
So be sure to dedicate enough time in training and education,
a feedback system, and ensuring users are getting value from the tools.
Which brings us to the tools part of the BI strategy.
One of the most important concepts to note here is to choose each tool with
the user in mind.
Consider which dashboards, reports and other solutions will be most effective.
Ask, do different users, teams and departments require different
technologies? Which technologies do we have access to?
Can we gain access to others if needed?
How will we measure success?
Here you want to establish key performance indicators or KPIs for
each particular business need.
Soon you'll learn a lot more about KPIs and
explore how organizations use them to achieve objectives every day.
But for now, just understand that a KPI is a quantifiable value,
closely linked to business strategy, which is used to track progress towards a goal.
In other words, KPIs direct you towards achieving your desired results.
But in order for KPIs to do their job, it's important that the tools you select
align with the KPIs established for each particular project.
The last step in this process is documenting everything you've learned.
Many BI professionals use specific BI documents to note stakeholder
requirements, project requirements, and strategy.
These are essential tools that can really help you capture the big picture,
stay organized, and make an impact at your organization.
You'll learn exactly how to create these documents in an upcoming reading.
As a final point, keep in mind that your particular level of involvement in BI
strategy will vary depending on the size and structure of your business and team.
But having a broad understanding of all the elements
involved is a valuable asset for any BI professional. 

## Key business intelligence documents

Previously, you learned about business intelligence strategy, which is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in the business intelligence process. BI projects are complicated, and finding ways to stay organized from the beginning of a project to the end is key to success. One way to ensure that you capture the big-picture project requirements, stay organized, and make an impact at your organization is to create comprehensive BI documents. In this reading, you’ll learn about three types of documents: the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirements Document, and Strategy Document.

Each of these documents builds on the previous one. Instead of three separate documents, think about them as three phases of your project planning process. Later on, you will have an opportunity to create your own BI documents to guide your end-of-course project, so this is a great resource to get you started!

### Stakeholder Requirements Document

The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:

    Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?

    Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?

    Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?

    Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful?

Here are some questions BI professionals ask in order to successfully complete this document:

    What questions must be answered before starting this project?

    What does the BI team need to know before starting this project?

    What are the questions that must be answered/problems that must be solved by this project?

    What datasets are considered important to this project?

    Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?

Typically, the Stakeholder Requirements Document is a one-pager with notes, but it can be longer and more detailed for complex projects.

Click the link to access the stakeholder requirements document template, or download the file directly from the attachment below. Stakeholder Requirements Document template

### Project Requirements Document

Once you have established the stakeholder requirements, you can start thinking about the project requirements that need to be met to achieve the stakeholder requirements. The Project Requirements Document contains the following details:

    Purpose: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explanation of why the company should invest its resources in it.

    Key dependencies: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are there any inter-team deliverables required?

    Stakeholder requirements: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.

    Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.

    User journeys: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.

    Assumptions: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.

    Compliance and privacy: Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.

    Accessibility: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it?

    Roll-out plan: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?

In addition, some companies will ask you to include a list of references. If so, it’s a best practice to be liberal in citing references; you can never have too many. References might include:

    Documents or websites you read and researched while working on this project

    Laws and policies: Any regulations driving the project requirements

    Project tracking: A link to tracking spreadsheet, bug hotlist, etc.

    Similar projects: A description of anything similar that has been attempted in the past or any parallel efforts.

Similar to the Stakeholder Requirements Document, the Project Requirements Document will vary depending on the complexity of the project. It might just be an email sent out to stakeholders to keep them updated on expectations and check-in points, or it could be a multi-page document with a spreadsheet that outlines the project plan and key tasks.

Click the link to access the project requirements document template, or download the file directly from the attachment below. Project Requirements Document template

### Strategy Document

Finally, you will create a Strategy Document for your project. This is the final phase of the planning process. The Strategy Document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. You will work together to establish information about dashboard functionality and associated metrics and charts.

This is a time to flesh out what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders think through these details and help the BI professional make final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get valuable feedback.

Generally, the BI professional will create the document and request review and sign-off from important stakeholders. Then they can begin working on the project with all of the details they need.

_Staying organized and aligned with stakeholders is an important part of the BI process. Creating documents early on in a project to outline stakeholder and project requirements as well as project strategies can be an important tool for a BI professional aligning with stakeholders and planning ahead. Soon, you’ll have an opportunity to create your own documents to align with stakeholders and plan your end-of-course project!_


## ACTIVITY: Complete the BI documents

Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create the project planning documents that you would use to prepare for a business intelligence project. This includes a Stakeholder Requirements Document, a Project Requirements Document, and a Strategy Document. To fill out each section, you will use your meeting notes. 

Project planning documents help you confirm project details with your stakeholders and prepare to complete a BI project.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 
Scenario

Review the following scenario, then complete the step-by-step instructions.

In this scenario, you are working as a BI professional for a fictional consumer-to-consumer sales company, MarkIt. You recently attended a meeting with key stakeholders to gather details about this BI project. Refer to the following notes from the meeting. Use the information they contain to complete the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirements Document, and Planning Document. If you need additional guidance, refer to the previous reading: Key business intelligence documents

.

Note: These notes are intentionally incomplete. Keep track of the information that is missing in the notes that will help you complete the templates.
Meeting Notes: 

Stakeholders: 

Alice Shi, Vice President of Sales

Matías Sosa, Program Manager

Team members: 

Ariana Tirado, Data Warehousing Specialist

Cornelia Vega, Manager, Data Governance 

Sam Winters, Data Analyst

    Dashboard needs to be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives

Background info:

MarkIt maintains an online platform that facilitates previously-owned item sales between individual buyers and sellers. The goal is to understand how these buyers and sellers use their platform. The insights could then inform new-product design and improve the platform. 

The team wants to review data that tracks the number of listings posted; the number of sales completed; and the number of listings deleted on a daily, quarterly, and yearly timescale. They also want to better understand search query behavior that buyers have when searching for an item. For example, if a buyer searches for more different types of items, are they more or less likely to complete a purchase? Do broader search terms mean a user is less committed to making a purchase?

Project goals:

    Understand what customers want, what makes a successful sale, and how to improve experience for buyers and sellers

    Understand how the platform is used by both types of users: How much time do users spend on the site? What pages do they spend the most time on? How do buyers conduct searches, and how do sellers create and maintain listings? How do buyers and sellers contact one another?

    Discover how we can apply insights related to search query behavior

    Understand pain points in the sales process

The ask/metrics:

    Include fields for customer ID/username, item category (such as clothing or household goods), and date.

    Determine if we can add a chart illustrating how long the listings for completed sales are online before the sale is completed.

    For buyers: Include a chart comparing the number of searches made and the number of sales completed.

*Tool must be created in four weeks!

Roll-out:

Week 1: Dataset assigned. Initial design for fields and UserIDs validated to fit the requirements

Week 2: SQL and ETL development

Week 3: Finalize SQL, dashboard design, and first draft review with peers

Week 4: Dashboard development and testing

Questions:

How is the online platform used by buyers and sellers?

How can we apply insights related to data generated by sales and search queries?
Next steps

As you use these notes to complete the key BI documents, take time to consider:

    How to organize the various points and steps

    How to group similar topics

    Whether the information is relevant to the project

    Whether the metrics are effective or not

Step-By-Step Instructions

If you don’t have a Google account, you can download the templates directly from the following attachments.

Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the stakeholder requirements document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.

The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:

    Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?

    Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles? 

    Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?

    Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful? 

Here are some questions BI professionals ask to successfully complete this document:

    What questions must be answered before starting this project? 

    What does the BI team need to know before starting this project? 

    What are the questions that must be answered and/or problems that must be solved by this project?

    What datasets are considered important to this project?

    Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?

Typically, the Stakeholder Requirements Document is a one-page document with notes, but it can be longer and more detailed for complex projects. 

Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the templates you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.
What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed planning documents: 

    A Stakeholder Requirements Document, completed as fully as possible with information from your notes 

    A Project Requirements Document, completed as fully as possible with information from your notes 

    A Strategy Document, completed as fully as possible with information from your notes 

    At least three questions about missing information from the interview notes


### COMPLETED EXEMPLAR 

Assessment of Exemplar

In this activity, you practiced completing key BI planning documents based on a realistic scenario. The scenario was intentionally missing important information, so part of your task was to identify what you were missing and come up with follow-up questions you could ask the stakeholder. This activity will prepare you to complete these forms in future projects throughout your career.

Project planning docs help you understand the needs and expectations of your stakeholders. This allows you to communicate with them effectively and better understand how to complete the project. You will be able to determine what information will most help you meet the project needs.

Your documents don’t have to perfectly match these exemplars. The goal is to properly organize the information into the correct fields and understand how planning documents help you prepare for a BI project. This is an opportunity for you to check your understanding, ensure that you’ve met the activity’s expectations, and explore a possible solution.

In the Stakeholder Requirements Document exemplar, you’ll notice that areas where you’re missing information are highlighted in bold. In your own projects, you might find it helpful to note what you’re missing directly on the document. Then, when you ask follow-up questions, you can replace those notes with the correct information.

Most of the information in these docs is pulled directly from the notes in the activity’s scenario. You might also reword something to summarize or expand on notes from the meeting. For example, the notes include “The goal is to understand how these buyers and sellers use their platform. The insights could then inform new-product design and improve the platform.” You might translate this into the business problem section of the planning doc by wording it as “How do buyers and sellers use MarkIt’s platform? How can MarkIt improve their platform?” This frames the language in the notes as a question instead of a statement.

In the Project Requirements Document exemplar, you need to assign each of the stakeholder’s requests as “required,” “desired,” or “nice to have.” A hint for what belongs where can be found in the language the stakeholders use. In the scenario notes, some of the requests might have “must,” while others might have “can we?” or “should.” 

You’ll also find that this document has more fields that are missing information. This can provide clues about what you should ask in follow-up meetings.

The Strategy Document exemplar is the longest document and has more missing information. But because this is the stage where you can determine what kinds of charts you might make, many of your answers can be left to your best judgment. Unless the stakeholder tells you what kinds of charts they want, you will need to use your BI expertise to decide what works best. In this scenario, the stakeholders didn’t give you any chart type suggestions. This means you can make the decisions yourself or decide to follow up with the stakeholder for more guidance. 

The Strategy Document is also where you might include a sketch of a mockup. 
A dashboard mockup that plans filters and charts for a BI dashboard on MarkIt’s sales information.

This mockup includes filters for timescales, such as daily, weekly, and monthly. It features the current status and historical charts of the following metrics: sales completed, listings posted, listings removed, and popular search terms. It has a bar chart comparing total site utilization with the average site utilization per user. It also has a bar chart with the distribution of contact methods used to submit support requests. 

This sketch represents a first draft of what your dashboard might look like when you get to the visualization stage of a BI project. You'll learn more about mockups, including how to use a mockup to plan a dashboard, later in this program.
Key takeaways

Filling out planning documents is a helpful way to organize details from your conversations with stakeholders and prepare for a business intelligence project. You’ll use these skills later in this course when you begin your own BI project.


## Case study: FeatureBase
### Part 1: Fine tuning metrics for data collection

In this course, you've been thinking about the stages of the business intelligence process. This case study with FeatureBase will focus on the Capture stage of the BI process, where you examine static, backward-facing data and plan for the next two phases of the project. In two follow-up case studies, you’ll learn about how FeatureBase addressed the Analyze and Monitor stages of this project. But first, you’ll need to understand the problem, process, and solutions for this first stage of the project.
Infographic outlining a the Problem, Process, and Solution cycle

As a BI professional, you will add value to the organizations you work with. Your expertise will help organizations access the right data, use data to find ways to grow and improve, and put those insights into action. Throughout this certificate program, you will have the opportunity to explore how different businesses handled real challenges they faced using business intelligence. In this reading, you will be introduced to FeatureBase

, an Operational AI company in Austin, Texas. Across the three courses, you will encounter three case studies that follow the FeatureBase team’s approach to an actual problem they faced. This is a great example of how a real company solved a BI problem and completed an entire project–Starting with identifying a problem and preparing to tackle it! 
FeatureBase log
Company background

FeatureBase builds technologies that unlock the value of data as soon as it is created. Based in Austin Texas, the team and community consist of database, distributed systems, and cloud engineers, as well as leading researchers on bitmap innovation. FeatureBase’s CEO, H.O. Maycotte, and founding engineers have worked for nearly 20 years to solve a gap in the database market and develop a new data format that is built specifically to enable faster computation.

Their core technology, FeatureBase, is the first OLAP Database built entirely on bitmaps that power real-time analytics and machine learning applications by simultaneously executing low latency, high throughput, and highly concurrent workloads.
The challenge

The sales team noticed that a significant portion of potential customers were falling off during the sales cycle. Once they discovered this pattern, they realized that they didn’t have the data they needed to really discover when customers were falling off. And if they couldn’t determine when customers were falling off, then they couldn’t find out why. And finding out why was key for creating solutions to address this problem.
The approach

The initial question was, “Why did we fall short on our quarterly revenue target?” To answer that question, the FeatureBase team needed to know why people dropped off and when drop-off happened. But they didn’t have the metrics built into their database to actually measure that. In order to build this question into their data collection, they had to experiment with what data was actually useful, add new attributes, and refine their metrics. For this particular project, the solution was clear: recreate their existing sales funnel with key attributes about each potential customer at every stage of the project. 

To do this, the Sales leader, Marketing leader, and CEO collaborated to decide on new metrics and how to implement them within the system. It required some experimentation– the team was committed to iterating and fine tuning their data collection process in order to optimize this solution. Tuning is often a really necessary part of creating forward looking solutions; the first model is usually not the best one. It’s a first draft; you have to revise it in order to achieve the most ideal version of the solution! As a BI professional, the reality is that you might have to iterate a few times to get your model where you need it.
The next step

As a BI professional, there will be times when you are asked a question that you don’t have sufficient data to actually answer. Sometimes, you have to keep digging, keep researching, and keep thinking about how to provide an insightful answer your team can actually use. In this case, the FeatureBase team realized they had observed that there was a trend, but they couldn’t determine what it was and how to act on it with the data they had. The first step was deciding what metrics they could implement to actually capture useful observations. As a team, they collaborated and fine tuned their data collection processes. Coming up in the next course, you’ll learn more about how they actually imposed these new processes on their database systems, what tools they used, and how that set them up for success. 

If you’re interested in reading more about FeatureBase’s approach to answering this question, you can find more in the FeatureBase part two
 and part three
 readings featured in upcoming courses. 


 ## The business intelligence professional’s toolbox

 Business intelligence may seem like a new concept, but it's actually been around for
centuries.
All throughout history business leaders from around the world have used BI to set
the bar for best practices.
In fact, the term business intelligence dates back to 1865,
when it appeared in the encyclopedia of commercial and business anecdotes.
The book used the term to recount how a banker, Sir Henry Furnace,
had great business success by collecting data and
quickly acting on information before his competitors could.
It described Furnace as having created a complete and
perfect train of business intelligence.
Well all aboard, because in this video we're going to get your BI train moving.
And just like any train trip, this one starts with mapping out where you are and
where you want to go.
In BI, mapping a route requires a data model,
which is the first tool in your toolbox.
Data models organize data elements and how they relate to one another.
They help keep data consistent across systems and
explain to users how the data is organized.
This gives BI professionals clear directions when navigating a database.
All right, the second stop on our train ride, and
the second tool in your toolbox, is the data pipeline.
A data pipeline is a series of processes that transports data from different
sources to their final destination for storage and analysis.
Think of the data pipeline as train tracks, spanning, passing, and
crossing over vast distances.
Data is transported along these channels in a smooth automated flow from
original sources to target destination.
But that's not all. Along the way, it's up to BI professionals to
transform that data so that by the time it pulls into the station or
database, it's ready to be put into use.
One example of this is ETL, or extract, transform, and load.
As a refresher, ETL is a type of data pipeline that enables
data to be gathered from source systems, converted into a useful format,
and brought into a data warehouse or other unified destination system.
The process of ETL plays a key role in data integration because it
enables BI professionals to take data from multiple sources,
consolidate it, and get all that data working together.
Okay, now we've come to our third tool, data visualizations.
You likely know that data visualization is the graphical representation of data.
Some popular data viz applications are Tableau and Looker.
These apps make it possible to create visuals that are easy to understand and
tell a compelling story.
This way people who don't have a lot of experience with data can easily access and
interpret the information they need.
Think of data visualizations as the photos you share with friends and
family after your train trip.
The best ones are clear, memorable, and highlight the specific places you went,
the important sites you visited and the interesting experiences you had.
BI professionals use data visualizations within dashboards.
Our final stop on the ride.
As you may know, a dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that
monitors live
incoming data. Picture the dashboards
used by train drivers. They pay close attention to these tools
in order to constantly observe the status of the train engine and other important equipment.
Dashboards keep the drivers connected with the control center to ensure that
routes are clear and signals are functioning properly.
And the drivers can quickly scan the dashboard to identify any hazards or
delays that might affect train speed or schedule.
No matter which BI tool you're using,
a very important concept in our field is iteration.
Just as the railway workers are constantly evaluating and upgrading trains,
tracks, and other systems, BI professionals always want to find new solutions and
innovative ways to advance our processes.
We do this through
iteration. Iteration involves repeating a procedure
over and over again, in order to keep getting closer to the desired result.
It's like a railway engineer repeatedly testing out signaling systems
in order to refine and improve them to ensure the safest
possible environment for
railway travelers. In upcoming courses, you'll learn a lot more about iteration, and
you'll go much more in depth with all these exciting tools.
You'll also explore all the ways you can transfer your skills and
experience with one tool and apply them to another.
Thanks so much for joining me on this journey,
we've got many more thrilling destinations coming up. 


## Technologies and best practices

As you continue through this program, you will be introduced to a variety of business intelligence tools that will help you create systems and processes and provide stakeholders with insights they can use to guide business decisions. Depending on the organization, you might end up using different tools over time. Luckily, the skills you are learning now can be transferred between tools. In this reading, you’ll be given some best practices for creating pipeline tools, data visualizations, and dashboards that you’ll be able to apply no matter what programs or tools your organization uses. 

### Optimal pipeline processes

Developing tools to optimize and automate certain data processes is a large part of a BI professional’s job. Being able to automate processes such as moving and transforming data saves users from having to do that work manually and empowers them with the ability to get answers quickly for themselves. There are a variety of tools that BI professionals use to create pipelines; and although there are some key differences between them, these are many best practices that apply no matter what tool you use. 

#### Modular design

As you have learned, a data pipeline is a series of processes that transport data from different sources to their final destination for storage and analysis. A pipeline takes multiple processes and combines them into a system that automatically handles the data. Modular design principles can enable the development of individual pieces of a pipeline system so they can be treated as unique building blocks. Modular design also makes it possible to optimize and change individual components of a system without disrupting the rest of the pipeline. In addition, it helps users isolate and troubleshoot errors quickly. 

Other best practices related to modular design include using version control to track changes over time and undo any as needed. Also, BI professionals can create a separate development environment to test and review changes before implementing them.  

Other general software development best practices are also applicable to data pipelines.

#### Verify data accuracy and integrity

The BI processes that move, transform, and report data findings for analysis are only useful if the data itself is accurate. Stakeholders need to be able to depend on the data they are accessing in order to make key business decisions. It’s also possible that incomplete or inaccurate data can cause errors within a pipeline system. Because of this, it’s necessary to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data, no matter what tools you are using to construct the system. Some important things to consider about the data in your pipelines are: 

    Completeness: Is the data complete?

    Consistency: Are data values consistent across datasets?

    Conformity: Do data values conform to the required format?

    Accuracy: Do data values accurately represent actual values?

    Redundancy: Are data values redundant within the same dataset?

    Integrity: Are data values missing important relationships?

    Timeliness: Is the data current?

Creating checkpoints in your pipeline system to address any of these issues before the data is delivered to the destination will save time and effort later on in the process! For example, you can add SQL scripts that test each stage for duplicates and will send an error alert if any are found.

#### Creating a testing environment

Building the pipeline processes is only one aspect of creating data pipelines; it’s an iterative process that might require you to make updates and changes depending on how technology or business needs change. Because you will want to continue making improvements to the system, you need to create ways to test any changes before they’re implemented to avoid disrupting users’ access to the data. This could include creating a separate staging environment for data where you can run tests or including a stable dataset that you can make changes to and compare to current processes without interrupting the current flow. 

### Dynamic dashboards

Dashboards are powerful visual tools that help BI professionals empower stakeholders with data insights they can access and use when they need them. Dashboards track, analyze, and visualize data in order to answer questions and solve problems. The following table summarizes how BI professionals approach dashboards and how it differs from their stakeholders:

Element of the dashboard  /  BI professional tenets  /  Stakeholder tenets

Centralization
	
    Creating a single source of data for all stakeholders
	Working with a comprehensive view of data that tracks their initiatives, objectives, projects, processes, and more

Visualization
	
    Showing data in near-real time
	Spotting changing trends and patterns more quickly

Insightfulness
	
    Determining relevant information to include
	Understanding a more holistic story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions

Customization
	
    Creating custom views dedicated to a specific team or project
	Drilling down to more specific areas of specialized interest or concern

Note that new data is pulled into dashboards automatically only if the data structure remains the same. If the data structure is different or altered, you will have to update the dashboard design before the data is automatically updated in your dashboard.

#### Dashboards are part of a business journey

Just like how the dashboard on an airplane shows the pilot their flight path, your dashboard does the same for your stakeholders. It helps them navigate the path of the project inside the data. If you add clear markers and highlight important points on your dashboard, users will understand where your data story is headed. Then, you can work together to make sure the business gets where it needs to go. To learn more about designing dashboards, check out this reading from the Google Data Analytics Certificate: Designing compelling dashboards. 

### Effective visualizations

Data visualizations are a key part of most dashboards, so you’ll want to ensure that you are creating effective visualizations. This requires organizing your thoughts using frameworks, incorporating key design principles, and ensuring you are avoiding misleading or inaccurate data visualizations by following best practices.

#### Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization

Frameworks can help you organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference. Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data visualizations: 

    The McCandless Method
    Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup

#### Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels

Creating effective visuals involves considering how the brain works, then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. 

#### Design principles

Once you understand the pre-attentive attributes of data visualization, you can go on to design principles for creating effective visuals. These design principles are vital to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that convey your data effectively to your audience. By keeping these rules in mind, you can plan and evaluate your data visualizations to decide if they are working for you and your goals. And, if they aren’t, you can adjust them! 

#### Avoiding misleading or deceptive charts 

As you have been learning, BI provides people with insights and knowledge they can use to make decisions. So, it’s important that the visualizations you create are communicating your data accurately and truthfully. To learn more about effective visualizations, check out this reading from the Google Data Analytics Certificate: Effective data visualizations.

Make your visualizations accessible and useful to everyone in your audience by keeping in mind the following:

    Labeling
    Text alternatives
    Text-based format
    Distinguishing
    Simplifying

To learn more about accessible visualizations, check out this video from the Google Data Analytics Certificate: Making Data Visualizations Accessible.

### Conclusion

As a BI professional, you will encounter a variety of tools for creating pipeline systems, developing dashboards to share with stakeholders, and creating effective visualizations to demonstrate your findings. Those tools require different skills, which take time and effort to learn. But often, you can apply your knowledge to numerous processes and systems.

## Gagan: Get connected

My name is Gagan.
I am the director of data and analytics team in finance.
My teams focus on data BI, reporting and visualization solutions for our partners.
Our job is to make data more useful so
people can make good business decisions using that data.
So when I started my career, I started in software development and
there were no data teams at the time.
There were no dedicated data science functions at the time.
If you asked my prior version from 20 years ago and
imagine that where I would be, I would have never imagined I'd be here at Google.
I would have never imagined I'd be doing this as a full-time job.
There were multiple individuals who are really good at a lot of different aspects
of what makes a really good BI person.
If I'm working on a problem, I talk to people.
I figured out over the course of time working with different individuals for
example, I talked to one of my managers.
She was really good at coding.
Her SQL code and how she wrote it and how well organized it was, I learned so
much from her.
I also worked with another individual in my career who was
really good at organizing and understanding how to design metrics.
I met with another person who was really good at telling stories through data.
So I had this opportunity of informal networking and
working with these individuals who I really admired for
what they brought to the table and learning from them.
Over the course of time,
there are a lot of networking opportunities that have arisen.
There are lots of LinkedIn groups.
There are a lot of professional networks perhaps where you're working perhaps
outside.
There are local chapters of BI data science analytics that you could
be a part of.
So I have over the course of time, the resources have changed and
the resources that I've utilized have also changed.
But I would say the early for many years of my BI experience,
data analytics experience, those individuals that I was able to understand
and the specific skills that they brought to the table was very useful.
Networking is not about reaching to somebody who's more experienced or
more senior than you.
It's building and understanding how to reach out to the right people,
how to make those connections.
If you actually take the word networking out and say "What am I trying to do?"
It's actually building good professional relationships.
And like any relationship, it's a two way street.
What can you offer in that partnership?
You might think you don't have anything to contribute and
you are only trying to learn from the individual.
They definitely might have more technical expertise or
the experience behind them, but they do not have the life experiences,
the domain expertise from where you're coming from.
And they might value understanding where you're coming from and
how you're trying to grow as well. 

## Quiz-taking tips and techniques

As you know, you'll complete
a graded assessment at the end of each section in the course.
And now's the time to prepare for your first one.
This assessment will be an effective way to verify
your understanding of key business intelligence concepts.
It will also help you build
confidence in your understanding of
BI while identifying any areas
where you can continue to improve.
Assessments can sometimes feel overwhelming,
but approaching them with a strategy
makes them much more manageable.
Here's a list of tips you can use
to set yourself up for success.
Before taking an assessment, review your notes,
the videos, readings, and most
recent glossary to refresh yourself on the content.
During the assessment, take your time.
Review the whole test before filling in any answers.
Then answer the easy questions.
Skip the ones you don't know the answer to right away.
For multiple-choice questions, focus
on eliminating the wrong answers first.
Also, it's a good idea to read each question twice.
There are often clues that you might miss the first time.
If you start to feel anxious,
calm yourself with some mental exercises.
One way to do that is by completing
a simple math problem in
your head or spelling your name backwards.
This also helps you recall information more easily.
Before you submit the assessment,
check your work, but be confident.
Sometimes people change an answer because it feels wrong,
but it's actually correct.
Your first instinct is usually the best one.
Finally, trust yourself.
Often people know a lot
more than they give themselves credit for.
Everyone learns at different
speeds and in different ways.
But it's important to maintain your momentum.
Take the time you need and when you feel ready,
keep going ahead. You've got this.

# REVIEW GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS CERTIFICATE CONTENT

## Data analysis process

Now that you understand all the phases of the data life cycle,
it's time to move on to the phases, of data analysis,
they sound similar, but are two different things.
Data analysis, isn't a life cycle, it's the process, of analyzing data.
Coming up, we'll look at each step of the data analysis process, and
how it will relate to your work as a data analyst.
Even this program is designed to follow these steps, understanding these
connections, will help guide your own analysis, and your work in this program.
You've already learned that this program is modeled, after the stages,
of the data analysis process.
This program is split into courses, six of which are based upon the steps,
of data analysis, ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
Okay, let's start with the first step in data analysis,
the ask phase, in this phase, we do two things.
We define the problem to be solved, and we make sure, that we fully understand
stakeholder expectations, stakeholders, hold a stake in the project.
They are people, who have invested time, and resources into a project, and
are interested, in the outcome.
Let's break that down, first defining the problem means, you look
at the current state, and identify how it's different, from the ideal state.
Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of, or
something wrong that needs to be fixed.
For instance, a sports arena might want to reduce the time fans spend,
waiting in the ticket line.
The obstacle is figuring out, how to get the customers,
to their seats more quickly, another important part of the ask phase,
is understanding, stakeholder expectations.
The first step here, is to determine, who the stakeholders are,
that may include your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners.
There can be lots of stakeholders, but what they all have in common,
is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and
have specific goals, they want to meet.
They also care about the project, and that's why it's so
important to understand their expectations.
For instance, if your manager assigned you, a data analysis project
related to business risk, it would be smart to confirm,
whether they want to include all types of risks, that could affect the company.
Or just risk related to weather, such as hurricanes, and tornadoes,
communicating with your stakeholders is key in making sure you stay engaged, and
on track throughout the project.
So as a data analyst, developing strong communication strategies,
is very important.
This part of the ask phase, helps you keep focused, on the problem itself, not
just its symptoms, as you learned earlier, the five wise are extremely helpful here.
In an upcoming course, you'll learn how to ask effective questions, and
define the problem, by working with stakeholders.
You'll also cover strategies, that can help you share, what you discover,
in a way that keeps people interested.
After that, we'll move on to the prepare step, of the data analysis process.
This is where data analysts collect, and store data, they'll use for the upcoming,
analysis process.
You'll learn more about the different types of data, and how to identify which
kinds of data are most useful, for solving a particular problem.
You'll also discover why it's so important, that your data and
results are objective, and unbiased.
In other words, any decisions made from your analysis,
should always be based on facts, and be fair, and impartial.
Next, is the process step, here, data analysts find and
eliminate any errors and inaccuracies, that can get in the way of results.
This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into more useful format,
combining two or more data sets to make information more complete.
And removing outliers, which are any data points, that could skew the information.
After that, you learn how to check the data you prepared to make sure it's
complete, and correct, this phase is all about getting the details right.
So you'll also fix typos, and consistencies, or missing, and
inaccurate data, and to top it off, you can strategies, for verifying and
sharing your data cleansing with stakeholders.
Then, it's time to analyze, analyzing the data you've collected involves using
tools to transform and organize that information.
So that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and
drive informed decision making.
There are lots of powerful tools data analysts use in their work, and,
in this course you'll learn about two of them.
Spreadsheets, and structured query language, or SQL,
which is often pronounced sequel.
The next course is based on the share phase, here,
you'll learn how data analysts interpret results, and share them with others,
to help stakeholders make effective, data driven decisions.
And the share phase, visualization is a data analyst best friend,
so this course will highlight why visualization is essential,
to getting others to understand, what your data is telling you.
With the right visuals, facts and figures, become so much easier to see, and
complex concepts, become easier to understand.
We'll explore different kinds of visuals, and some great data visualization tools.
You'll also practice your own presentation skills by creating compelling slide shows,
and learning how to be fully prepared, to answer questions.
Then we'll take a break from the data analysis process, to show you all of
the really cool things you can do, with the programming language r.
You don't need to be familiar with r, or
programming languages in general, just know that r is a popular tool for
data manipulation, calculation, and visualization.
And for our final data analysis phase, we have act, this is the exciting moment,
when the business takes all of the insights you,
the data analysts have provided.
And puts them to work, in order to solve the original business problem, and
will be acting on what you've learned, throughout this program.
This is when you prepare for your job search, and
have the chance to complete a case study project.
It's a great opportunity, for you to bring together everything you've worked on,
throughout this course.
Plus, adding a case study to your portfolio, helps you stand
out from the other candidates, when you interview for your first data analyst job.
Now you know the different steps of the data analysis process, and how our course
reflects it, you have everything you need to understand, how this course works.
And my fellow googlers and I, will be here to guide you, every step of the way. 

## Data strategy

Earlier, I told you that
you already have analytical skills.
You just might not know it yet.
When learning new things,
sometimes people overlook their own skills,
but it's important you take
the time to acknowledge them,
especially since these skills are going to
help you as a data analyst.
In fact, you're probably more
prepared than you think. Don't believe me?
Well, let me prove it.
Let's start by defining what I'm talking about here.
Analytical skills are qualities and
characteristics associated
with solving problems using facts.
There are a lot of aspects to analytical skills,
but we'll focus on five essential points.
They are curiosity, understanding contexts,
having a technical mindset,
data design, and data strategy.
Now, you may be
thinking I don't have these kinds of skills,
or I only have a couple of them,
but stay with me and I bet you'll change your mind.
Let's start with curiosity.
Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something.
Curious people usually seek out
new challenges and experiences.
This leads to knowledge.
The very fact that you're here with me right
now demonstrates that you have curiosity.
All right, that was an easy one.
Now, think about understanding context.
Context is the condition in
which something exists or happens.
This can be a structure or an environment.
A simple way of understanding context
is by counting to 5,
1, 2,
3, 4, 5.
All of those numbers exist in
the context of one through five,
but what if a friend of yours said to you,
"1, 2, 4, 5, 3."
Well, the three will be out of context.
Simple, right? But it can be a little tricky.
There's a good chance that you might not
even notice that three
being out of context
if you weren't paying close attention.
That's why listening and trying
to understand the full picture is critical.
In your own life, you put
things into context all the time.
For example, let's think about your grocery list.
If you group together items like flour, sugar,
and yeast, that's you adding context to your groceries.
This saves you time when you're at
the baking out, at the grocery store.
Let's look at another example.
Have you ever shuffled a deck of
cards and noticed the joker?
If you're playing a game that doesn't include jokers,
identifying that card means
you understand it's out of context.
Remove it and you're much
more likely to play a successful game.
So now we know you have
both curiosity and the ability to understand context.
Let's move on to the third skill, a technical mindset.
A technical mindset involves the ability to
break things down into smaller steps or pieces,
and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
For instance, when paying your bills,
you probably already break
down the process into smaller steps.
Maybe you start by sorting them by the date they do.
Next, you might add them up and
compare that amount to the balance in your bank account.
This would help you see if you can pay your bills
now or if you should wait until the next paycheck.
Finally, you'd pay them.
When you take something that seems like a single task,
like paying your bills,
and break it into smaller steps with an orderly process,
that's using a technical mindset.
Now let's explore the fourth part of
analytical skill set, data design.
Data design is how you organize information.
As a data analyst,
design typically has to do with an actual database,
but again,
the same skills can easily be applied to everyday life.
For example, think about
the way you organize the context in your phone,
that's actually a type of data design.
Maybe you list them by first name instead of last,
or maybe you use email addresses instead of their names.
What you are really doing is designing
a clear logical list
that let you call or text
a contact in a quick and simple way.
The last but definitely not least,
the fifth and final element of
analytical skills is data strategy.
Data strategy is the management of the people,
processes, and tools used in data analysis.
Let's break that down.
You manage people by making sure they know how to use
the right data to find
solutions to the problem you're working on.
For processes, it's about making sure
the path to that solution is clear and accessible,
and for tools, you make sure
the right technology is being used for the job.
Now, you may be doubting
my ability to give you an example
from real life that demonstrates
data strategy, but check this out.
Imagine a mower in a lawn.
Step one would be
reading the owner's manual for the mower.
That's making sure the people involved,
or you in this example,
know how to use the data available.
The manual would instruct you to put on
protective eyewear and closed-toe shoes.
Then it's on to step 2,
making the process,
the path clear and accessible.
This will involve you walking around the lawn,
picking up large sticks or
rocks that might get in your way.
Finally, for step 3,
you check the lawnmower, your tool,
to make sure it has enough gas and oil
and is in working condition
so the lawn can be mowed safely.
There you have it. Now you know
the five essential skills of a data analyst.
Curiosity, understanding context,
having a technical mindset,
data design, and data strategy.
I told you that you are already an analytical thinker.
Now, you can start actively practicing
these skills as you move through the rest of this course.

## Data governance

Metadata and metadata repositories are
very powerful tools in the Data Analyst Toolbox.
As we discussed previously,
data analysts use them to
create a single source of truth,
keep data consistent and uniform,
and ensure that the data we work with is accurate,
precise, relevant, and timely.
These tools also make it easier to access
and use data by standardizing our processes.
In this video, we'll explore
more components of metadata and
learn how metadata analysts
work to keep things organized.
We know that the amount of data
out there continues to grow,
but lots of businesses just aren't using their data.
Sometimes they don't know what they have,
sometimes they can't find it,
or sometimes a business just doesn't trust it.
Especially in bigger companies,
data can spend numerous different processes and systems,
and pulling together data from
so many places can be a big challenge.
For example, let's say a company starts out with
a traditional data storage system in its offices,
but then as the amount of data
it owns continues to expand,
cloud storage is needed too,
plus this company could also be accessing and using
second or third party data from a partner organization.
Each of these systems has
its own rules and requirements,
so each organizes the data in
a completely different way adding even more complexity.
It's no wonder so many organizations
struggle to find the right data at the right moment.
On the other hand, metadata is stored in
a single central location and gives the
company standardized information about all of its data.
This is done in two ways.
First, metadata includes
information about where each system
is located and where
the datasets are located within those systems.
Second, the metadata describes how all of
the data is connected between the various systems.
Another important aspect of
metadata is something called data governance.
Data governance is a process to ensure
the formal management of a company's data assets.
This gives an organization
better control of their data and helps
a company manage issues related
to data security and privacy,
integrity, usability,
and internal and external data flows.
It's important to note that data governance is about more
than just standardizing terminology and procedures,
it's about the roles and responsibilities of
the people who work with the metadata every day.
These are metadata specialists and they
organize and maintain company data,
ensuring that it's of the highest possible quality.
These people create basic metadata identification
and discover information,
described the way different datasets work together,
and explain the many different types of data resources.
Metadata specialists also create very important standards
that everyone follows and
the models used to organize the data.
There's one thing they all have in common,
whether they worked at a tech company,
a non-profit association, or a financial institution,
metadata analysts are great team players.
They're passionate about making data accessible
by sharing with colleagues and other stakeholders.
If you're looking for a role that
encourages you to explore
all the data that the digital world has to offer,
following the path to becoming
a metadata analyst may be the right choice for you.
But either way, businesses
of all kinds face market trends and
competition and they need to understand
why one process works while another doesn't.
Data analytics allows them to answer
key questions and keep improving.
