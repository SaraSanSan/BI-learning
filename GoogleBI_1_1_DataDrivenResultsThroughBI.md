# GET STARTED WITH BI

## Welcome to the Google Business Intelligence Certificate

Our world is constantly shifting and transforming.
Companies everywhere are working to lead the way
to the next big thing,
and consumers expect rapid, exciting product launches
and packages that are delivered
to their doorsteps like magic.
With all of this incredible change,
the value of speed has become immeasurable.
It's truly one of the most important factors
of business success today.
After all, the ability
to identify an issue or opportunity is great,
but real value is achieved when you identify that issue
before it becomes a huge problem,
or act upon that opportunity ahead of the competition.
These days, there's more data about
marketplaces, organizations,
customers, competitors, and employees than ever before,
but we need more than data alone
to make better decisions and deliver rapid results.
And that's where intelligence comes in...
business intelligence.
Business intelligence, or BI,
involves automating processes and information channels
in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights
that are easily available to decision-makers.
In other words, by showing decision-makers
what is currently happening,
organizations become more intelligent and successful.
A national restaurant group might analyze
millions of customer receipts
to optimize its food supply and reduce waste,
or a local hospital could integrate
numerous different data sources
to review feedback and outcomes
in order to help personalize the patient experience,
or perhaps a global manufacturing company
uses supply chain data from around the world
to make more precise demand forecasts
and ensure appropriate inventory levels.
The BI applications are endless,
and so are the BI career opportunities.
The field involves such diverse organizations and industries,
that wherever your interest may be,
there's a path for you.
In this program alone, you'll learn about
everything from appliance manufacturers to grocery stores
to local artisans to artificial intelligence companies.
BI professionals are making an impact everywhere.

## Google Business Intelligence Certificate overview

Hello, and welcome to the Google Business Intelligence Certificate! In this program, you will explore the growing field of business intelligence (BI), learn how BI is crucial to organizations and the people they serve, and develop the relevant skills for a future career in the field. By completing the three courses in this certificate program, you'll prepare for entry-level positions in BI. No prior BI experience is required to complete the program, but a foundational background in data analytics is strongly encouraged.

### Enter a growing field

Companies report the largest skills gap in data analytics, and the demand for data analytics skills is growing over 15 times faster than the demand for the average skill in the US. Every business process, in organizations of all types and sizes, generates huge volumes of data. This data may be stored in different locations and formats that are difficult to access and don’t provide useful insights. To use that data to effectively inform business decisions, it needs to be retrieved, structured, interpreted, and reported in usable formats that enable stakeholders to understand and act. BI professionals play an extremely important role in this process: They manage data retrieval; organize data; interpret data in different ways to fit the problem at hand; and create data visualizations, dashboards, and other tools to provide stakeholder-ready insights.

Throughout this program, you will have multiple opportunities to develop your BI knowledge and skills. You will explore concepts and scenarios to learn what an entry-level BI professional must know and be able to accomplish to thrive in the field.

### Google Business Intelligence Certificate courses

## Sally: Personal career journey

Hi, I'm Sally.
I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst at Google.
What that means is,
I work with data to help improve the hiring experience at Google.
The way in which I entered data analytics is via a business boot camp that I did
years ago. I was thinking of becoming biomedical researcher
and this is something I just wanted to use during extra time that I had.
We learned about just data analysis in general and
I found that I had like a knack for it.
Everything just made sense.
It was very tangible.
You can see the results pretty immediately and you could search for things.
I love puzzles, so trying to find using different clues and
trying to find what is the answer.
And I really enjoyed it as well as enjoyed working with teams,
which is different from when I was in the sciences.
It was very much independent, I was doing my own thing.
But within the business boot camp, I was working within a group of people and
that was so social and so much fun.
And we were supporting each other and I love that, that team environment.
Through the program is how I got my first job.
There was someone I met on the program who graduated a year before me.
And when it was time for me to apply for jobs, he had an opening on his team and
he reached out to me to see if I wanted to apply.
So that's actually how I got into data analytics.
I didn't study data analytics.
I had to teach myself everything from, I had to teach myself SQL.
I didn't feel like I was really contributing or
that I had any security in this field.
And so what I tried to do is I try to teach myself python, go
into machine learning, and what not.
But ultimately, what I found is, I don't need to do that.
I just need to find a niche - what I'm good at - and develop that and
become an expert in that.
So the advice that I would give for
someone who's trying to enter the field of business intelligence,
is to consider the difference between data analytics and business intelligence.
I personally found that I really like SQL.
Love SQL on the technical side of things.
In addition to that, so I wanted to level up and enter business intelligence.
You can make your career within the broader field of data analytics be
whatever you want, depending on what it is that you enjoy.

# THE ORGANIZATIONS AND TEAMS THAT BENEFIT FROM BI


## Explore business intelligence careers

We often hear about all of
the data that's created each and every day.
It could be something as simple as taking
a photo with your phone or paying your bills,
or something as complex as a global company launching
a new product or running
a multimedia advertising campaign.
It really feels like practically everything creates data.
So it's no wonder that organizations need
experts to help them access the right data,
use it to find ways to grow and
improve, and put those insights into action.
In fact, as the volume of data is ever
escalating so is a need for
professionals who can make that data shine.
For instance, in my role,
I'm proud to be able to use data to
give my stakeholders a quick overview
of exactly what they need to
know without getting lost in the details.
The tools I create enable them
to clearly evaluate the candidate
hiring and employee experiences
within Google's People Operations.
One way this works is by showing my stakeholders how long
the interview journey is when
someone is being hired at Google.
This is important because it
helps them determine if we need to hire
more recruiters or interview schedulers
in order to improve the process for our candidates.
In this video, you'll learn more
about how those of us in BI offer
value to our colleagues and how we help
shape the future of our organizations.
There are so many different potential roles to explore.
For example, in this program,
you'll learn a lot about BI analysts and BI engineers.
BI analysts gather requirements from stakeholders,
partners, and team members.
They use their understanding of
large datasets to retrieve,
organize, and interpret data.
Then they create visualizations, dashboards,
and reports to use when
presenting and communicating insights to others.
The intelligence they share
might be used to make decisions,
develop a new process,
or create a business strategy,
or it could be applied to even deeper analysis.
BI engineers are responsible for designing,
configuring, implementing,
and improving data tools and processes.
They evaluate and streamline various devices,
infrastructures, and
information channels called pipelines.
Engineers are excellent troubleshooters and
help find solutions to security issues,
application permissions and updates,
and other technical challenges.
In other words, a BI engineer
manages tools and processes,
which enables a BI analyst
to put those tools and processes to work.
However, it's also important to note
that some companies don't distinguish
between those two BI jobs, using
the terms analyst and engineer interchangeably.
So when you begin to explore job opportunities,
be sure to spend some time researching the job and
organization in order to
fully understand what's involved.
No matter which path you ultimately choose,
a career in BI has a potential to be amazing.
Research shows that all industries
today need skilled BI professionals.
But there are not enough people with
the right experience and talent to satisfy this demand.
BI professionals enjoy strong career prospects.
In fact, a quick search for job openings in the industry
reveals thousands of opportunities on LinkedIn alone.
But perhaps best of all,
BI professionals find the work
rewarding and fulfilling because
we know what we do makes someone else's life better.
Coming up and throughout this program,
you'll discover some really inspiring examples of
just how BI makes such a positive impact.
I can't wait to share them with you. 


## Business intelligence drives change - PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

As you have been learning, a business’s ability to identify issues before they become problems or act on opportunities before their competition is key to intelligent decision-making. Now more than ever, we have access to data about our marketplace, organizations, customers, competitors, and employees. But in order to turn that data into rapid results, we need business intelligence. Business intelligence involves automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers. 

In this reading, you’re going to explore two examples of how BI has helped real businesses gain insights, access the right data, and find ways to grow and improve their processes to put those insights to work. 

Key takeaways:

No matter what industry you’re working in, BI can automate processes and information channels to empower the people who need that data to answer questions and make decisions. From restaurants reducing waste to hospitals advancing patient care, BI analysts create systems and tools to anticipate needs and enable organizations to reach their objectives. 

### Restaurants reducing waste 

Two customers at a restaurant using a tablet to order while worker watches

Consider a fictitious scenario about a fast-food restaurant chain. Leaders at this company have huge amounts of data to manage, such as: customer transactions, marketing data related to promotions, customer satisfaction, employee information.

And so much more! But on top of all of that, the company also has to consider the logistics for individual restaurants. That’s where the problem comes in.

The problem:

The restaurants need to have ingredients to cook and serve customers, but if they have too much, that extra stock often goes to waste. 

Company leadership consults with their BI team to consider how to approach two concerns: How to ensure the restaurants’ numerous locations have enough ingredients to meet customer demand; and how to reduce food waste

However, these stakeholders currently don’t have metrics in place to specifically measure food waste or strategies to reduce it. This is exactly where the BI team will need to start.

The solution:

In order to address the stakeholder’s needs, the BI team spends time gathering information about current metrics and processes. They first use this information to determine what data they have and how it’s being used. 

They discover that there are already useful metrics being applied in other ways by various teams in the company, including: How many ingredients are delivered to each location; How much of each menu item is made each day; How much of each menu item is actually being ordered each day.

By comparing these existing metrics, the company can better understand how much food is going to waste. Thus, the BI analysts are able to gather the necessary information on incoming food delivery, customer orders, and food consumption in the form of a dashboard for stakeholders to monitor food waste. The BI analysts then organize this data within the database systems and deliver it to new tables that report the results for stakeholders to consider as they strategize how to reduce food waste. 

The results:

Knowing how much food is actually going to waste now enables stakeholders to better achieve their goals. The restaurant chain discovers that the largest source of food waste is the French fries. Across their locations, 10–20% of French fries are left over at the end of the month. With this information, the company’s central operations team sends out a memo to all branches recommending they reduce their incoming French fry delivery by 10%. In this way, the BI analysts are able to help the business identify an area for improvement and reduce waste. 


### Hospitals promoting patient care

Hospitals also have to manage a lot of different kinds of data — especially patient information. They also have a variety of data sources that they need to access and share to ensure that other connected users — such as doctors working outside of the hospital — can get patients the treatment they need without wasting time or resources. 

The problem:

For this scenario, consider a hospital system that’s challenged to communicate effectively with doctors who don’t work within the same hospital system. Administrators have noticed that this creates a few different problems: Doctors outside of the system can’t access test results from the hospital; Patients are being tested multiple times.

This is expensive and inefficient, both for the hospital and patients. So, decision-makers choose to work with a team of BI specialists to create database systems that get data in the hands of doctors who need it. 

The solution:

Basically, this hospital system is experiencing a problem related to inaccessible patient data. There is a lot of data streaming in from multiple source systems that needs to be consolidated into one destination that can be used by doctors, including information about: Previous visits; Tests; Allergies.

And other relevant medical information. So, the BI team develops a pipeline system that ingests data from all key sources, processes and transforms it so that it is consistent, and delivers it to a database system where doctors are able to access all the information they need.

The results:

By streamlining the hospital’s many data sources into one consolidated database, the BI team helps save the hospital money and resources by eliminating duplicate tests. Now, doctors are better able to treat patients, patients save money on redundant tests and procedures, and the hospital can run more efficiently. This is all thanks to the tools built by the BI team!
