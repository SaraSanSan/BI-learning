# | Decisions: DASHBOARDS & REPORTS |

# AUTOMATE & MONITOR

You’ll build charts and organize them to create dashboards that effectively monitor data for the long term. In addition, you’ll put yourself in the role of a BI professional by meeting with a client, practicing question-asking and communication skills, and using the information the client provides to inform your project.

Learning Objectives:

    Make design choices based on stakeholders’ needs.
    Create effective data visualizations.
    Create dynamic dashboards to track long-term data.
    Apply design best practices to create effective and descriptive dashboards that meet business objectives.
    Demonstrate insights and impact of BI research visually.


## Welcome to module 3

In BI, we often don't know
how long our tools and solutions will be used,
so what we build must be flexible and responsive.
Of course, designing dashboards that are
adaptable in this way takes practice.
In this section, we're going to focus on how to build
dashboards that can effectively
monitor data for the long term.
We'll also keep practicing
creating dashboards in Tableau.
But this time, there's a twist.
You're going to apply the decision
making principles you learned
about earlier to a realistic business scenario.
You'll get to really envision yourself in
your future role as a BI professional.
This exercise will also
enable you to practice identifying
stakeholder needs and addressing them
with your own fully functional dashboard.
You'll meet with your client and use the information they
provide to build relevant charts in Tableau.
You'll organize the charts into a dashboard,
share it with users,
address their feedback and iterate on your dash.
Now, it's time to get started.
Get ready for the next big milestone in your BI journey. 



# BE THE BI PROFESSIONAL IN A REALISTIC SCENARIO

## Complete a dashboard project

Creating a dashboard is a collaborative process
between the BI professional and stakeholders.
I like to compare it to an elaborate dance among
talented partners that require skill,
communication, and practice.
Coming up, you'll focus on
the "practice" part of the dashboard dance.
The next few lessons encompass a roleplay exercise.
Similar to past courses,
you'll learn from videos,
readings, activities, and quizzes.
However, you're also going to
take on a whole new perspective:
You are a BI professional who has
just been given a new project.
The first video you'll encounter will be
a simulated video call with your stakeholder.
You won't actually interact with them,
but you'll experience the basics of
a typical meeting to explore BI project details.
Then, you will proceed to
readings — or emails, in this role-play setting —
to get more context about
the project and hints about how to proceed.
These emails will be similar to the ones you'll receive from
stakeholders and supervisors in a professional setting.
All of these elements will enable you to complete
activities and produce deliverables.
The goal of this exercise is to
practice applying your decision-making and design skills.
Some of the instructions may be open-ended
and require you to try out different approaches.
Rather than being directed through each click
to make a predetermined chart in Tableau,
you'll be asked to design a chart
that matches certain parameters.
The guidance you receive will
focus on how to meet stakeholder needs,
rather than how to use the program itself.
You may develop something,
then decide that it could be improved on or
that it doesn't adequately meet expectations.
That's great. You're encouraged
to practice trial and error —
that's a big part of BI.
But you won't be completely on your own.
Readings will come from your supervisor and clients,
who will offer clues and
redirections about their expectations.
Immerse yourself in the BI professional role
and envision your future in this field.
Explore each step at your own pace,
and try all kinds of different strategies as you plan,
build, and iterate on your dashboard.
While this exercise consists of
fictional details and practice data,
you'll gain some awesome business insights
as you complete it. Have fun! 


## Potential pain points when long-term monitoring

Business intelligence monitoring involves building and using hardware and software tools to easily and rapidly analyze data and enable stakeholders to make impactful business decisions. As you design dashboards for long-term monitoring, there are a few common obstacles users might encounter that can make dashboards harder for them to use. In this reading, you’ll get a short checklist of potential obstacles, known as “pain points.” These are things to keep in mind when you build out the case study dashboard—and as you build dashboards in the future! 

This will help you build more user-friendly dashboards that your team and stakeholders can use long-term.

Three possible obstacles for long-term monitoring. Pain points can change depending on the scale of the dashboard—the larger the scale, the more additional context is required to make the data understandable for users. However, there are three general obstacles you might encounter:

1. Poorly defined use cases: The ways a business intelligence tool is actually used and implemented by the team are referred to as “use cases.” When designing a dashboard that includes live-monitoring, it’s important to establish how the different views will be used. For example, if you only include one “executive view” with no way to drill down into specific information different users might need, it leaves a lot of the interpreting work to users who may not understand or even need to understand all of the data.

2. Isolated snapshots: Snapshots of the latest information can be useful for reports, but if there’s no way to track the data’s evolution, then these snapshots have a pretty limited utility. Building in tracking for users to explore will help them understand the snapshots better. Basically, tracking means including insights about how the data is changing over time.

3. Lack of comparisons: When creating a dashboard, implementing comparisons can help users understand whether the visualizations being presented indicate good or bad performance. Comparisons place KPIs side-by-side in order to easily examine how similar or different they are. Similar to adding more context to snapshots, adding comparisons is a fast way to ensure users understand why the data in the dashboard is useful.

- Key takeaways

In upcoming activities, you are going to work with stakeholders to create a dashboard designed to monitor incoming data and provide as close to real-time updates as possible. When designing dashboards, it’s important to keep the user in mind. Identifying potential pain points they might encounter and addressing those problems in your design phase is a great way to guide your process and generate more useful, accessible, and long-lasting solutions for your team.


## Andrea: Power of a BI specialist

I'm Andrea I'm a senior data analytics analyst in my job.
I have the power to make recommendations to senior leadership and
to influence their decision making process by going into the data processing it and
trying to make sense of what I'm looking in the numbers.
My users, my clients are financial analysts or financial managers that need
to use the finance data that I'm producing to make their decisions,
create the reports and then translate those analysis into actions that
are going to influence how google is going to look like in the future.
I use business intelligence tools every day.
I mostly use SQL and Python. SQL to create the large data sets that I work with.
Python to make sense of those data sets and do some statistical analysis and
then create a story that then I'm going to share with my leadership.
But a few times I get to use dashboard when I use dashboards I make sure that
the visualization I'm creating, it looks nice, it's pretty but
the most important thing is that the story that I'm telling is compelling and
it's easy and fast to understand because my audience doesn't have time one,
you can make sense of the data and come back to your audience and
explain that story and share with them what you're seeing.
But at the same time proposing some recommendations,
that's when the job gets really exciting you as a business intelligence analyst.
You are the one going into the data, you are the one spending hours looking at
this data set so no one else is going to know the answer better than you and
no one else is going to be able to put this story As you wanted to put it.
So I will say it really gives you a lot of power when you know what's going on
looking into the data and when you go back to your audience and
you're making a recommendation or a proposal, you have the power to tell
the story in a compelling way and you have the power to influence and have long term
because your decision makers are going to use your inputs to then make a decision.
That is probably going to last for 5, 10 years. 


## Role-play with a stakeholder

Hey there and thanks for meeting with me today.
Your supervisor told me that you were the one to come to if I needed a dashboard built.
I appreciate you taking the time. Feel free to take notes if you like, but I'll send an email with the most important information after this call.
Okay.
I'll jump right into the details.

I'm with the Minnesota Department of Transportation, and we're trying to find trends in traffic volume on the interstate.
The goal is to find out if we need to make any infrastructure changes, like adding or changing lanes, entrances, or exits.
We want to have a dashboard that monitors the incoming traffic data.
If we can find trends in the data, we can figure out what changes we should make.

The dashboard should track a couple of key things.
The most important chart will monitor the traffic volume throughout the year.
It'd be great if you could organize that by year, month, week, day, and hour. It'll help us figure out where the patterns are.
Another chart we'd like to have is one that compares the traffic volume to weather conditions.
We want to better understand the weather's effect on traffic behavior. 
And finally, we want to know which holidays have the highest traffic volume.

That might help us plan some infrastructure updates so we don't have any lanes blocked off when they're needed the most.
I'll also be sure to share these details and the data set with you right away.
You'll get the traffic volume data set that includes data collected since 2012.
This should be enough to demonstrate the key trends.

That's all I have for you now.
Your supervisor should have the rest of the details to help you get started.
Thanks again for helping out on this.
Bye bye! 


## Prepare your project

In the previous video, the Minnesota Department of Transportation contacted you about building a dashboard to help their team monitor traffic patterns. Their goal is to learn more about: 

    Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour
    Traffic volume in different weather conditions
    Traffic volume on different holidays

Knowing traffic patterns under these conditions will help the team make important infrastructure decisions. These decisions will ensure that any construction in the future won’t cause problems for drivers. In this reading, you’re going to learn more about upcoming expectations for this project, what you’ll be doing, and you will also receive important project planning documents to help guide your next steps.

- What to expect:

Now that you’ve met with the stakeholders for this project to discuss expectations, you’ll have the opportunity to start building your dashboard monitoring tool. This project is going to be a little different from other activities you have completed so far. While there will still be guided activities to help you achieve all of the project requirements, you will be primarily responsible for managing this project yourself. The goal is to explore how BI professionals work with stakeholders in an actual business environment and get an opportunity to practice responding to their needs throughout the project lifecycle. So, you will have a lot of freedom to work on this activity however you choose! This will also set you up for success as you move into the last phases of your end-of-course project.  

Throughout this section, you will receive email correspondence from your supervisors and team members with helpful information, tips, and strategies for completing the project deliverables. Read these messages carefully for hints about how to complete the upcoming activities!

As you continue with this roleplay scenario, keep in mind that you can return to any of the previous materials to refresh your memory or check your understanding. And, if you run into any issues, remember that you can connect with fellow learners in the discussion forums to ask questions and problem-solve together!
Coming up next

Once you have familiarized yourself with your stakeholders’ requests and their expectations, you can move on to the next part of this project: designing the charts for your dashboard. 


# CREATE A CHART FOR A STAKEHOLDER

## Data-driven charts

Earlier in this course,
you practiced creating a chart in Tableau
and reviewed some design best practices.
Now that you're working on a dashboard for
the Minnesota Department of Transportation,
you'll apply your skills to this project.
You have the data, the BI planning documents,
and the business requirement,
which is building a dashboard using the traffic data.
It'll be up to you to decide
how many charts you need on your dashboard.
There are four questions that will
help you move forward successfully:
Which parts of the dataset will
enable you to address the business requirement?
Which measures and dimensions
will be represented in each chart?
Which chart types and forms of
encoding will be most effective?
And how many charts are required?
Here's an example. I recently
worked on a project about Google human resources.
The project goal was to better understand HR changes
over time so processes could be optimized.
For the first question,
I chose to include data about
active employees and turnover,
team hierarchies, and
recruitment in order to tell an insightful story.
After that, I chose which measures
and dimensions to represent in each chart.
I knew that for one of my charts,
I wanted counts of active employees aggregated over
dimensions of both time and team hierarchy data.
Once I did that,
I experimented with how to encode
the data to be as clear as possible.
As a refresher, encoding
describes the process of translating
dimensions and measures into
visual representations of the data.
I asked myself, "Which chart types and
forms of encoding would be most effective?"
When doing this, you might
discover that a certain concept is better
represented with colors on a map
instead of bars on a chart — or vice versa.
I ended up using a variety of
chart types while working on my HR project:
line charts to represent total employees over time,
stacked bar charts to show employees by product area,
and even waterfall charts to show how
both new hiring and
turnover contributed to net changes over time.
Ok. The final question is: How many chart types are required?
For instance, you might decide that
more than one visualization is
needed to answer a particular question.
Or you could choose to dedicate just one chart to each.
For my project, I made
a point to empathize with my stakeholders.
Using my knowledge of the problems they're
trying to solve enabled me to select
the right trade-offs between keeping the dashboard
focused versus providing lots of detail.
Answering these four key questions
and drawing your mockup will prepare you to
create the best charts possible for
your Minnesota Department of Transportation scenario.
Then, you'll be ready to move on to the next part,
when you'll design your actual dashboard.
If you get stuck while building your charts,
refer to the upcoming reading.
This is an email from your supervisor that
will help you identify the best path forward.
You can also go back to the previous sections of
this course to review different
aspects of chart building.
Let's use your BI knowledge and design skills to make
some visualizations that will really "wow" your client! 


## Erica: How BI tools are put to work

Hi, my name is Erica.
I'm a technical program manager at Google.
I had a bit of a winding career journey
going from flying planes
to data analysis to
now where I'm at as a technical program manager,
I went to the Naval Academy for my undergrad degree.
After that, I went on to be
a Navy pilot flying P3 Orion's.
Transitioning out of the military,
there was a lot that I still needed to learn
about business intelligence data analysis.
As I entered my new job after the military,
I did a lot of that learning on my own.
I really utilized online resources, YouTube,
and a lot of just trying things out and
learning by playing around with different systems.
I think it was intimidating for sure to have to
learn these new skills quickly and to be able
to deliver on what I needed to for my job.
But I think I overtime you embrace that,
those nerves and you learn that I can do this,
I can learn this new skill.
I can ask for help.
For one of the projects that I'm
working on now we have a dashboard that
tracks engagement with this system that we've created.
Dashboards are a way to visually present
information and allow others to draw insights from it.
But imagine if you didn't have a dashboard and you are
just presenting people with a table of data.
It would be very hard for
them to draw any useful insights.
Especially someone maybe a leadership who
doesn't have time to dig through data themselves.
You're presenting in a way that's
useful and allows people to quickly draw
insights or maybe even interact with it by changing
some filters and understand
what they need to know about that data.
We're looking at a historical trend over time.
Seeing how engagement in
our case has been increasing over time.
Maybe some dips when different things
happened throughout the life of this new system.
That allows us to gain insights and understand,
maybe what we could do to increase engagement.
I think when you have a way to
visualize the current state,
the historical state change over time that
allows you to notice when things aren't right.
If it's just raw data in a spreadsheet or in a table,
you might not be able to easily gain
that insight and you might miss something,
something that is impacting
your program or whatever it is,
your product that you
wouldn't catch unless you are visualizing
the data in a way that allowed you
to notice those discrepancies.
Every dashboard is going to have
a different goal, I would say.
There's probably for whatever project or
program or whatever the purpose of the dashboard is,
there's probably some key performance indicators
that you're going to want to be
tracking on the dashboard.
Typically you'll know what those are based on
the questions that you get asked
frequently about the data or about the program.
I really love making
dashboards because I think it's so rewarding when
you're creating something that's useful to
many people and allowing
them to be more effective in their jobs.
I was looking for a job that kept me challenged.
That was probably my number one
criteria that I was looking for.
I've definitely found that here where
I'm just constantly learning,
talking to experts in their fields every day.
It's really something that I'm grateful for. 


## Email from your supervisor: Chart design

Good morning!

Thank you again for taking on the Minnesota Department of Transportation dashboard project—I am confident that you will be able to help their team out with this!

Actually, I just had a call with our point-of-contact, Camila. I know that you’re getting ready to design the charts for their dashboard, so I wanted to share some insights from her that might help you make some decisions for this project.

They have been specific about the three charts they’re most interested in including for this dashboard:

    Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour
    Traffic volume in different weather conditions
    Traffic volume on different holidays

As you explore the dataset, there are a few specific columns that would be a good starting place for what data to include: date_time, traffic_volume, weather_main, and holiday. Camila also shared that you may need to create custom columns and filters to the dataset in order to get the metrics you need. She told me that’s totally fine and you should feel free to work with the data however you think is best!

She and I also discussed what measures and dimensions should be represented in each chart. You probably have some ideas already, but here are some that Camila pointed to specifically in our call:

    Chart 1: Traffic Volume and Date Time
    Chart 2: Traffic Volume, Date Time, and Weather Main
    Chart 3: Traffic Volume, Date Time, and a custom measure for Holidays

Finally, just as a reminder: if you get stuck designing, remember to refer to some of our team resources like the Design Resource Guide!

Thank you again for all your help,

Jack Park
Team Supervisor


## Activity: Create your charts

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create charts for the roleplay scenario you’re working on. You’ll visualize data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation to help them improve infrastructure on the Minneapolis interstate.

This activity will help you to brainstorm how to connect stakeholders’ business needs to charts and visual designs. You will apply everything that you have learned up to this point about chart design to sketch out a mockup first, and then design functional BI charts. You can begin by reading the hints in this activity, or begin on your own and refer to this activity if you need help.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As a refresher, you’ve been tasked with creating a business intelligence visualization to help the Minnesota Department of Transportation improve highway infrastructure. You had a video call with your stakeholder and received an email with details of their needs. Refer to the Role-play with a stakeholder video and Email from your supervisor: Chart design reading for more context on the scenario.

The most important charts you need to make should represent the following needs:

    Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour
    Traffic volume in various weather conditions
    Traffic volume on different holidays

You now have the freedom to answer however you think is best. You might create one chart for each of these needs, combine them into fewer charts, or create more charts to expand your insights. You might also experiment with different approaches to practice your design strategies. In an upcoming activity, you’ll have the opportunity to organize the charts you make into a dashboard.

- Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

1. Part 1 - Plan your charts:

Step 1: Access and examine the data

To use the data for this course item, download the following attachment.

Log into Tableau Public. On your profile page, click Create a Viz.

This will open the Connect to Data window. Load your data into Tableau Public by clicking Upload from Computer, then select the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data.csv file you downloaded.

Earlier in this course, you learned how to create a pen-and-paper mockup. Now, you should make one for this dashboard project. It can help you brainstorm the kinds of charts you’ll need, as well as the arrangement of those charts in your dashboard.

2. Part 2 - Create your charts:

Your stakeholder wants to be able to view the data at multiple timescales. They want to examine a monthly view to know which days are the busiest, then examine a daily timescale to find which times of day have the highest traffic volume.

Before you begin creating a chart and deciding which timescales to include in your visualization, return to the email from your supervisor. Make sure to evaluate all the timescales that your stakeholder asked for, then determine which charts will be appropriate to use. When you create your charts, ensure that they meet your stakeholders’ needs while also being the clearest and most effective solution to their problem. You might decide that one of the timescales won’t be very helpful for answering their questions. Or you might determine that all of them are necessary, so you can include all of them in your chart.

To change the timescale, right-click the date dimension you’re using. In the dropdown menu, select Year, Quarter, Month, or Day to change the timescale of your chart. You can also instruct your stakeholders to do this when they want to switch between timescales.
An arrow pointing to Month in the dropdown menu on the YEAR data dimension.

You might find that filters can help you answer your stakeholder’s questions. For example, you can use a filter to compare holiday traffic with traffic from normal days. 

Before you begin creating a chart and deciding which filters to include in your visualization, return to the email from your supervisor. Review your stakeholder’s requests and decide what kinds of filters would be most helpful in your visualization.

To add a filter to your chart, you can drag and drop a dimension into the Filters section of the interface. 
Section of Tableau interface that includes Pages, Filters, and Marks sections.

When you do this, a pop-up menu will open. 

An example of this is when you drag the Date Time dimension to Filters. Then, you can select Relative Date to show a range of dates relative to the current date. 
Filter Field window with Relative Date selected as a filter option.

The filter interface for time dimensions. Includes several settings for filtering dates based on different periods of time.

You could use this to show only data from the previous seven days, regardless of the date that you view the chart. You can also select any other specific window of time.

Since your stakeholder asked about the holidays with the highest traffic volume, it might help to make a calculation in Tableau. You used calculations in the analysis stage of the BI process, but you can also use them in visualizations. If you’re unsure about what kind of calculations might be appropriate for your charts, refer to the email from your supervisor.

To create a calculated field, click the dropdown arrow  for a column in Tableau’s data viewer. Select Create Calculated Field to open a code window.
The dropdown menu from Tableau's data viewer showing options used to customize data in the viewer.
The calculated field window where custom calculations are created.

In the window, copy and paste the following code: 

    if [Holiday] = "None" then null else "X" end

This will create a new column in your data called IS_HOLIDAY that will have an X value for each holiday and a Null value for each normal day. This column will only exist in Tableau, but you can use it in any charts that visualize holiday data.
Tableau’s Data Viewer including the new column created using calculated fields.

Accessibility is an essential part of building tools that everyone can use. Tableau has a built-in caption generator that automatically describes the details of your chart. 

To enable captions, click Worksheet from the main toolbar. Then select Show Caption from the dropdown. 
Dropdown menu demonstrating options for customizing a Tableau worksheet.

This will generate a caption, which you can edit or reformat to suit your needs.

Pro Tip: Save your charts

3. Part 3 - Save your charts:

You will use them to create a dashboard in an upcoming activity, and you can use them in your professional projects.

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed charts: 

    Charts answer business questions from the scenario.
    Charts use more than one style.
    Charts use proper titles, labels, and color schemes.
    Charts are built using a pen-and-paper mockup as a reference.
    Optional: Charts use at least one of the tips in this activity.


### Activity Exemplar: Create your charts

- Traffic volumes by month per year

This line chart compares traffic volumes for each month from one year to the next. This chart answers the question: Which month typically has the highest traffic volume? It uses the Date Time dimension with a filter to show the Month timescale. It also uses the sum of traffic volume from each period of time to make a singular total value of traffic volume at each month interval. Each point on the chart represents the total number of cars on the road during an entire month.

This exemplar has three lines on a chart to represent the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. The 2018 line ends in September, simulating how near-real-time data might make unfinished lines in a BI visualization.

< A line chart representing traffic volume for three years separated into months. There is one line for each year. >

You could also make other charts to represent different timescales. You could use a filter on the Date Time dimension to represent the sum of traffic volume at different months, days of the week, or hours of the day. These other charts answer the stakeholder’s questions about what times of day, week, month, and year have the highest traffic volume.

- Traffic volumes by hour

This heat map breaks down traffic concentration for each day and hour of each month. As you scroll through visualization, the chart automatically updates to display each month’s data. This chart lets you compare each day and hour of traffic to the next, detailing traffic volume down to the hour. Columns in this heat map represent the day of the month and rows represent the time of day. Higher concentrations of traffic are represented by the color of each square in the heat map, with orange demonstrating a higher volume while the darker blue squares indicate less traffic.  

< A heat map representing traffic volume each year separated into days, months, and hours. >

- Traffic volumes by weather pattern

This bar chart displays yearly traffic volume grouped by weather type. By including a date time filter that spans the years 2016 through 2018, you can represent total traffic volume for those years and group it by weather type. For example, in those years, there were 24 million cars on the road during days with clear weather, while traffic volume decreased to 10 million during rainy weather. This also answers the stakeholder’s question about the effect that weather has on traffic.

< A bar chart representing total traffic volume separated by weather type. Clear and cloudy weather have the most traffic. >

- Holidays with highest traffic

While examining the data for this project, you might decide that you want to create a new column that specifies which entries are on holidays. To make this chart, you should use the calculation described in the activity: if [Holiday] = "None" then null else "X" end. This will create a column that you can use to make a chart that compares only holiday traffic, such as this circle chart.

This chart uses color and size to compare the holidays with the highest traffic. The color represents the holiday, while the size of each circle represents the traffic volume on that holiday. The use of size and color in this way demonstrates relationships between numeric data, and presents it in a compact format. 

You could also make a bar chart to represent holiday data, which would provide a more direct comparison. But, this circle format gives you variation among your charts, which can be more engaging for your client. While making individual charts, it’s still important to keep in mind the design strategies you’ll use for your whole dashboard. If you only use one type of chart for every visualization, your dashboard can be too repetitive and less effective.

< A circle chart represents traffic volume on different holidays. The highest values are Labor Day and New Year's Day. >

- Key takeaways

In this activity, you examined your stakeholder’s needs and made charts to address them. Visualizing BI data is a nuanced process because there are lots of design best practices and data visualization strategies to use together. In upcoming exercises, you’ll use the charts you created to make and iterate on a dashboard. Through practice and time, you will develop your own visual style and design process. 



# CREATE A DASHBOARD FOR A STAKEHOLDER

## Well-organized dashboards

In the last lesson,
you created charts for the dashboard you're
designing for the Minnesota Department of Transportation.
Now, it's time to build the dashboard itself.
As you've learned, it's important to apply design
best practices when organizing dashboard elements.
This ensures they're laid out in
a logical manner and that you've
constructed a clear visual flow.
Feel free to review the lessons about
dashboard design before you continue.
As a reminder, you'll want to place
the most relevant visualizations at the top of the dash.
Then, use hierarchy and contrast to emphasize
supporting elements. And be sure to
consider how to incorporate
negative space between charts.
You'll likely find that your dashboard design experience
will depend on the choices you
made in the previous activity.
For example, if you created
many charts to describe Minnesota's interstate traffic,
then you'll have more elements to balance.
This is an example of yet another trade-off.
More visualizations enable you to display more data,
but you risk overwhelming
the client or slowing down the dash.
Use your best judgment to
identify the most effective outcome.
It's also possible that
a chart you thought you needed isn't really
necessary or that you're missing a chart
that's required to answer one of the business questions.
If so, simply return to
the chart-building phase and make the adjustments.
As you know, building
a dashboard is an iterative process,
so you can always change direction as you progress.
Just like before,
if you have any trouble, refer to
the reading to get hints from your supervisor.
Okay, now it's time to get building. 


## Email from your supervisor: Dashboard organization

Hey, good afternoon!

Great work on those charts for the Minnesota Department of Transportation dashboard project. I had a chance to check them out earlier—it seems like you’re making great progress!

You’ll be able to design this dashboard however you think is best. Just keep in mind that our clients want to be able to compare traffic volume at different points in time and at different timescales. They also want to check out the holiday and weather patterns throughout the year.

It will be up to you to decide how you’re going to arrange the charts. And, you can add some tooltips or captions if you think it will help our client. If you haven’t used tooltips before, they’re basically details that you can add so users can get more information when they hover over a mark in the current view.

Just as a refresher, I wanted to send you some resources the rest of the team has used in the past: a guide to designing compelling dashboards and the dashboard examples you explored previously.

Also, just want you to keep in mind some key guidance as you work through your design process:

    Consider the business question and stakeholder needs
    Organize your process with design thinking
    Avoid misleading or deceptive charts
    Prioritize accessibility
    Apply design principles

When you’re done, I’ll send your draft to our contact Camila so we can get feedback for a second iteration.

Keep up the good work,

Jack Park
Team Supervisor


## Activity: Create your dashboard 2

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a dashboard using the charts you made in the previous activity. The dashboard you make will answer the stakeholder’s business questions.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As a refresher, you’ve been tasked with creating a business intelligence visualization to help the Minnesota Department of Transportation improve highway infrastructure. You had a video call with your stakeholder to discuss the details of your project.

Now, refer to the email you received from your supervisor with hints about how to proceed. If you need a reminder about the scenario, refer to the stakeholder interview video.

- Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

To begin, open your chart file in Tableau Public. You should have published it on your Tableau Public account. If you have not completed this yet, return to the previous activity and create your charts.

Now that you have your charts open, click the New Dashboard button to create a new dashboard. Drag each chart from the menu to the dashboard interface.

In the previous activity, you created a mockup to help you plan your dashboard. You can use it as a reference or decide that you want to change your layout. Now that your charts are complete, you might find that your original plan is not the best approach. You have an opportunity to evaluate the mockup you made, make changes if necessary, and use it to design your dashboard.

In a professional situation, you would be able to get feedback on your mockup. Since you can’t get any specific feedback in this roleplay scenario, use your best judgment to evaluate your work.

Now that you have your charts ready to arrange, you might decide to emphasize a specific chart. Place this chart into your dashboard first and place the other charts around it. If your chart has a legend associated with it, make sure to keep it near the chart.

Next, you’ll decide the arrangement for the remaining charts based on the layout of your mockup. However you organize it, the layout should be logical. You might organize your charts from most to least important, more general insights to very detailed information, grouped by topic, or another way. You can use size, color, and other design elements to create a logical flow in your BI dashboard.

Make sure to arrange the legends along with the graphs. It can be hard to interpret your charts if the corresponding legends aren’t next to them.

Once you’ve arranged your charts, you can make additional adjustments to your dashboard. You might edit a caption on one of your charts, add a custom tile using the Tooltips function, or change your color palette. Your choices here should follow the design best practices from your design resource guide. Pro Tip: Save the template.

Finally, be sure to save your dashboard. You will iterate on it in an upcoming activity, and you can use them in your professional projects.

- What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed dashboard: 

    Includes at least three charts to answer the scenario business questions
    Uses charts you created in the previous activity
    Demonstrates chart hierarchy corresponding to the stakeholder’s requests


### Activity Exemplar: Create your dashboard

In this activity, you organized the charts you made for your stakeholder into a dashboard. You addressed the needs of your stakeholders with a BI visualization that contains multiple charts. You also had the opportunity to include helpful filters and other elements that can enrich your visualizations.

The exemplar dashboard for this activity features four charts and a legend. These charts include Traffic volumes by month per year, Traffic volumes by hour of the day, Traffic volumes organized by weather patterns, and a circle chart for Holidays with highest traffic. Together, these charts address your stakeholders’ main interests: comparing the traffic volume at different points in time and at different timescales, and examining holiday and weather patterns throughout the year. 

The legend specifies a separate color for each of the three years represented in the data. This visualization uses only three years of data in order to prioritize simplicity. If these charts featured data from all of the years, there would be too many lines and bars in the chart. This would make it much harder to read, and therefore much less effective as a visualization. Because the charts use data from the same years, the color schema can be consistent across all the charts. This way, the orange line in one chart corresponds to the same year as the orange bars in another chart.

In this dashboard, the line chart is placed at the top, alongside the legend. Since the legend applies to each of the charts, it’s important to place it at the top of the visualization. Beneath the line chart, there is a bar chart representing weather patterns and a circle chart representing national holidays in the United States. These charts have lower priority than the line chart, so they are placed lower in the dashboard.

Next to the three charts is a heat map representing the traffic volumes by hours of the day. Because a large amount of data is being visualized at once, this chart is larger than the others so stakeholders can view the data more easily.

The line chart and heat map represent two of the timescales in which the stakeholder is most interested: the monthly timescale and the weekly timescale. In these charts, your stakeholders can view which months and days of the week have the highest traffic volume. You can also find other trends: based on the line chart, it seems like the traffic volume for 2017 was generally higher than in 2016. 

Note: You also need to delete duplicate legends from your dashboard. Each time you add a chart to your dashboard, you might add a new legend. Unless the legends describe different encoding choices in your charts, you should keep the number of legends to a minimum.

- Key takeaways

A dashboard can be more than just an arrangement of charts. In this activity, you organized the charts you made for your stakeholder, but also had the opportunity to incorporate filters and other elements into your visualization. Now that you have assembled your dashboard, you can proceed to the next lesson where you will iterate on your dashboard to meet evolving stakeholder needs.



# ITERATE ON A DASHBOARD

## Dashboard iteration

By now, you've created a dashboard to
track traffic volume on the Minnesota interstate.
You created charts and organized them into
a powerful tool that your clients can use.
You've also learned about
the kinds of questions you should ask while creating a dashboard.
Now, in this video, we'll explore iteration.
We've covered many typical iterative improvements,
including changes to aesthetics, design approaches,
processing speed, privacy permissions, and many more.
There are all kinds of ways to
refine a dashboard during iteration.
Fortunately for you, your client,
the Minnesota Department of Transportation,
has clearly explained their feedback on your dashboard.
They've sent you an email with notes about your work.
The feedback is very positive,
but there's still some work to do.
Turns out another member of
the team wants some new features added to the dash.
It'll be up to you to figure
out how to best implement them.
There might be several ways to action this feedback,
such as editing an existing graph or creating a new one.
You may need to explore the dataset
again and pre-aggregate it with SQL.
Or, it's possible that
their request is inappropriate for the project.
If so, you'll need to be able to
justify why you're unable
to make the changes they've asked for.
As with all feedback,
keep an open mind about the stakeholders ideas.
Even when you're confident in your work,
it's always possible to learn something new.
Good luck on the last phase of
this role-play exercise. Have fun with it. 


## Email from your supervisor: Redirections and shifts in scope

Hello again!

Thanks for sending in your dashboard draft. I forwarded it to the Minnesota Department of Transportation team to review. Camila and I just had a call about it, and I wanted to share their feedback with you! She said it was great, but they do have some updates they wanted to ask you to make:

First, Camila shared that they wanted to share this dashboard with some of their team members who aren’t familiar with Tableau. She asked if it would be possible to add a dropdown menu to help them view the filters more easily?

They also requested a button on the dashboard that lets users download it directly from the interface.

Lastly, Camila brought up that they really just need data from 2017 onward. She asked if it would be possible to focus the chart on that time period, but view it at a variety of different timescales?

Overall, they were really impressed with the dashboard, and they’re excited about getting these updates added! Once you’ve incorporated their feedback, I’ll reshare the updated dashboard with them for final review. 

Thanks!

Jack Park
Team Supervisor


## Email from your coworker: Iteration tips

Hey!

Jack mentioned you were using Tableau to create the dashboard for the Minnesota Department of Transportation project. I actually just finished another project with Tableau, and just wanted to send you a quick note with some useful tricks I found while I was working on that dashboard.

Jack told me that the stakeholder wanted more user-friendly filters; I found that filter tiles are a really easy way to incorporate filters that users can interact with. Oh, and while I’m thinking about it, did you know you can set tiles to “floating” to make your dashboard arrangement more flexible? There’s a Tableau guide to Floating and Tiled Layout Arrangements on Dashboards you can check out.

Adding objects: Jack also mentioned that your stakeholders want to add a download button—you can use the Objects menu to add a lot of different artifacts, including a download button, images, and links. Actually, the Tableau Help page has a section in their Create a Dashboard guide about adding objects!

Also, I don’t know if you’re already familiar with tooltips, but they were really useful on my last project. Basically, they let you add extra details about the data that users can view when they hover over any marks in the view. The Tableau Help section about Tooltips covers the basics.

I hope this helps!

## Activity: Iterate on your dashboard

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will address feedback on the dashboard you made for the previous activity. This activity concludes a roleplay scenario in which you created a visualization for a fictional stakeholder with realistic business needs.

In your professional roles, you’ll need to address feedback on your visualizations. In this activity, you’ll practice determining the appropriate solution for your stakeholder’s needs. Making small but essential improvements to your work is an important part of a business intelligence professional’s role.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As a refresher, you were tasked with creating a business intelligence visualization to help the Minnesota Department of Transportation improve highway infrastructure. After you completed your dashboard, you shared your work with your stakeholder. They gave you positive feedback on your dashboard overall but wanted you to include a few more elements that would meet some new needs. 

The specific updates the stakeholder asked for are as follows:

    We would like to share this dashboard with some of our members who aren’t familiar with Tableau. 
    Please add a dropdown menu to help them view the filters more easily.

    Please add a button that lets users download the dashboard directly from the interface.

    We really just need data from 2017 onward. 
    Please focus the dashboard on that time period but enable it to be viewed at different timescales.

If you need hints on how to proceed, refer to the email you received from your coworker.

- Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

To begin, open your dashboard file in Tableau Public. You should have published it on your Tableau Public account. If you have not completed this yet, return to the previous activity and create your dashboard.

Now that you have your dashboard open, you can add, remove, or change elements to meet your stakeholder’s new requests.

In the dashboard interface, you’ll find a menu with several types of objects you can add to your dashboard. You can add images with the Images button, a navigational menu with the Navigation button, and a download link with the Download button. 

< Objects menu with Horizontal, Vertical, Text, Image, Web Page, Blank, Navigation, Download, Extension, and Ask Data buttons >

You can use these objects to add additional tiles to your dashboard that aren’t just charts. You can link to external web pages, add your own visuals, and create custom elements. All of these components can help you create a more complete story with your visualizations.

In the feedback you received, you were asked to focus your visualization on a specific timeframe. One of the ways you can accomplish this is with a filter. You’ve used filters in Tableau before, but now you’ll emphasize them for your users. 

To do this, you’ll add a tile to your dashboard interface that allows users to change filters themselves. This feature encourages your users to view different timescales or versions of your dashboard. It can be especially useful for non-technical stakeholders who might not know how to use Tableau.

To add a filter tile, click on one of the charts in your dashboard, then click the arrow to open a dropdown menu. Click Filters, then the dimension you want to filter by. 

This will add a tile to your dashboard that you can place anywhere you want. Now, your users can apply filters at will, even if they aren’t familiar with Tableau.

To make sure a filter applies to your whole dashboard, click the filter tile and then click the arrow to open the dropdown menu. Click Apply to Worksheets, then All Using Related Data Sources. This will ensure that a filter applied through this tile works on each chart in your dashboard.

Pro Tip: Save your new dashboard.

Finally, be sure to save your dashboard. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects.

Be sure to include the following changes in your completed dashboard: 

    Dashboard includes a download button
    Dashboard includes a filter tile that allows users to change timescales
    Dashboard only features data from 2017 to present day (without altering the data itself)


### Activity Exemplar: Iterate on your dashboard

In this activity, you iterated on the dashboard you made for your stakeholder. You made changes to your dashboard to address new stakeholder needs. In a professional setting, it’s important to make the right decisions so that your iterations meet your stakeholder’s evolving business needs.

This improved version of the dashboard addresses the new requests from your stakeholder. They want you to add a filter menu tile, add a download button, and focus on data from 2017 to present. It’s up to you to decide how to add these features to your dashboard. 

< Dashboard with the filter tile, download button, and 2017-to-present filter added. >

First, you can add a filter menu tile. This tile should be placed at the top of your dashboard. Because it applies to the rest of the charts, you want to emphasize its importance. 

The download button can be placed in one of the top or bottom corners. Some stakeholders might want to download a static version of the dashboard after they’ve viewed its current status. It might make the most sense to place it at the bottom of your dashboard, where your stakeholder will naturally end up. Alternatively, you might place it near the top of the dashboard if your stakeholder won’t spend a lot of time viewing the dashboard. If your client wants to generate a report quickly to send it to another team member, it would be most helpful to place it near the top where it is quickly accessible.

Finally, focusing on data from 2017 to present could be accomplished with a simple filter in the visualization. There are many ways to only visualize data from a certain time, but a filter is the simplest way to do it. You can even accomplish this with the filter tile you added earlier.

When making dashboard iterations, you might be under a lot of pressure to make quick changes. In this situation, you need to be able to assess which changes are the quickest to implement.

- Key takeaways

Now that you have iterated on your dashboard, you’ve completed the roleplay exercise. You started with a few stakeholder requests and created charts, a dashboard, and design edits to answer their business questions. In your role as a BI professional, you’ll go through this process every time you create a visualization. Now that you’ve practiced these steps, you’ll be prepared for the end-of-course project for this course and the professional projects you’ll work on in your career.



# Review: COMPLETE A BI VISUALIZATION

## Wrap-up

Congratulations on taking a practical hands-on approach
to a BI solution request.
You've now played the role of a BI professional,
applying your knowledge of dashboards and stakeholder
needs to a realistic work situation.
While the scenario took place
within a learning environment,
it contains several components that you
will find in a professional setting.
A stakeholder requested that you
build a traffic monitoring dashboard.
You took the information they shared,
then considered key questions,
and created a mock-up to help you select your charts.
Next, you created the charts,
which involves evaluating the dataset and
deciding what information to showcase and how.
Then it was time to
organize the elements of your dashboard.
Your stakeholders wanted a tool they can refer to for
immediate insights so you used
your BI skills to fulfill that need.
Finally, you receive feedback in iterated on your dash.
This involves thinking about
whether the requested changes were
feasible and made sense
within the context of the project.
Include this project in your portfolio to
share with hiring managers during your job hunt.
You're doing a great job
demonstrating all of your hard work.
