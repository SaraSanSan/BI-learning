## Welcome to module 3

In BI, we often don't know
how long our tools and solutions will be used,
so what we build must be flexible and responsive.
Of course, designing dashboards that are
adaptable in this way takes practice.
In this section, we're going to focus on how to build
dashboards that can effectively
monitor data for the long term.
We'll also keep practicing
creating dashboards in Tableau.
But this time, there's a twist.
You're going to apply the decision
making principles you learned
about earlier to a realistic business scenario.
You'll get to really envision yourself in
your future role as a BI professional.
This exercise will also
enable you to practice identifying
stakeholder needs and addressing them
with your own fully functional dashboard.
You'll meet with your client and use the information they
provide to build relevant charts in Tableau.
You'll organize the charts into a dashboard,
share it with users,
address their feedback and iterate on your dash.
Now, it's time to get started.
Get ready for the next big milestone in your BI journey.
