# | The Path to Insights: DATA MODELS & PIPELINES |

# DYNAMIC DATABASE DESING

You’ll learn more about database systems, including data marts, data lakes, data warehouses, and ETL processes. You’ll also investigate the five factors of database performance: workload, throughput, resources, optimization, and contention. Finally, you’ll consider how to design efficient queries that get the most from a system.
Learning Objectives

    Discover strategies to create an ETL process that works to meet organizational and stakeholder needs and maintain an ETL process efficiently.
    Understand what the different data storage and extraction processes and tools may include (Extract/L: Stitch/Segment/Fivetran, Transform: DBT/Airflow/Looker).
    Explain how to optimize when building new tables.
    Identify and describe where new tables can fit in the pipeline.
    Recognize the different aspects of databases, including OLAP and OLTP, columnar and relational, distributed and single-homed databases.
    Understand the importance of database performance and optimization.
    Describe the different five factors of database performance: workload, throughput, resources, optimization, and contention.
    Perform pipeline debugging using queries.
