## Introduction to Course 3

When a business intelligence professional works on a project,
they have to juggle many tasks.
They apply effective BI practices and tools in order to make a positive impact;
they engage with stakeholders and manage their expectations;
they extract data, transform it, and load it.
They optimize and maintain databases.
Then they get to begin the next exciting part of a BI professional's role:
monitoring and reporting.
These activities, bring together all aspects of BI to produce a usable tool,
visually represented data that can be shared with and understood by others.
After all, sharing data is what makes it powerful.
It's one of the key ways in which information becomes intelligence.
Hello, welcome to the final course of the Google Business Intelligence Certificate.
I'm your instructor, Terence and
I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst here at Google.
I'm excited to work with you as we explore data monitoring and
reporting as a BI analyst at Google.
I'm responsible for developing a deep understanding of the problems that my
stakeholders are trying to solve and
further, leveraging our data to provide solutions to those problems.
Sometimes these solutions are simple data queries or grids of numbers in a report.
But the best solutions are often dashboards with interactive visualizations
that can immediately draw attention to the most important trends and insights.
This can save hours of work for your team.
As we work together through this course, we'll focus on building visualizations and
reporting to stakeholders.
To do this BI professionals create visualizations and
dashboards that monitor data over time and continuously answer business questions.
Then they present these dashboards to their stakeholders and
improve on them as time goes on.
This enables businesses to make quick informed decisions using specially
built monitoring tools.
As a reminder a dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that
monitors live, incoming data.
You can create a dashboard for a variety of purposes, but
BI professionals mainly use them to display the data they've collected,
analyzed and tracked for a specific business purpose.
In this course, you'll learn to design dashboards, communicate about their scope,
then improve on the visualizations as business needs evolve.
First, you'll discover what kinds of information you need to know about
a project in order to prepare the right kind of dashboard.
you will explore how to empower stakeholders by designing interactivity
into the dashboard.
You'll also gain key tools and techniques to design dashboards yourself.
First, you'll make a plan to create dashboard mockups.
Then you'll explore tableau a commonly used data visualization tool which will
enable you to design your own dashboards and presentations in upcoming exercises.
You'll learn to make appropriate design tradeoffs and
whether to pre-aggregate your data in SQL, then you'll move on to designing charts
and organizing them into simple and effective dashboards.
You'll refine your visualizations to adapt to evolving business needs.
In addition, you'll gain some great strategies for presenting to and
communicating with stakeholders.
Having clear conversations with users about business needs and project scope
prepares you to create the best tools for your stakeholder client or user.
And you'll definitely use these communication skills to share your
work and launch your career as a BI professional.
Once you learn each of these skills,
you'll have the chance to apply them in a realistic business scenario.
You'll evaluate your stakeholders needs and decide how best to plan,
build and iterate on a dashboard.
So let's get going, I can't wait to share the exciting world of BI with you. 


## Terrence: A day in the life as a BI analyst

Hi, I'm Terrence and I'm a BI analyst at Google.
My team at Google, we're a central data
and analytics team in the finance organization.
We help make decisions related to headcount,
how we're investing Google's money,
how basic sales revenue is doing, profitability,
all of those metrics to help
make decisions within the finance org.
With business intelligence, I didn't have
any formal training in school or anything like that.
I started my career as
more of a traditional financial analyst.
Now I found myself being drawn to writing SQL,
creating pipelines that then
took that data and made it powerful for
everyone. That BI role was coming into its own,
and I found myself really drawn to that.
In my day-to-day when it comes to BI tools,
I'm on more of the project management side.
It's really about having
a really good familiarity with the tools that we
use that ultimately our data engineers
will be using to construct the pipelines,
whether that's Google Cloud Platform and
BigQuery, or all the way to dashboarding.
I have my hands in all of these things as I
see projects all the way through from conceptualization,
understand where the data is coming from.
Is this a feasible project?
Does the data exist in a way that we
can ingest it and transform it?
One of my biggest learnings is that
the simple solutions are often the most powerful.
The only way to really
understand what those solutions are
is to sit and really understand from your stakeholders,
your users, what they're trying to solve for.
You have to have a curiosity.
You have to have a burning passion to
go out there and want to understand,
"Hey, how does your business work?
What are the problems you're facing?
What questions are you trying to answer?
What's your day-to-day like?"
You have to have that really base understanding
and then deep understanding to really
go and take the data that may
be available to you and take it that additional mile.
Really pull out important insights.
Allow them to make decisions on data
that they didn't even know existed before.
You need to have that passion about
understanding the business, be curious.
Understand what problems they're facing.
And ultimately that's what I find
really fun about this field.
Being able to have that opportunity,
being able to be empowered to go
understand the problems that the business
is facing and come up with
really creative solutions to those problems with data.

# GET STARTED WITH DATA VISUALIZATIONS & DASHBOARDS

## Welcome to module 1

Hello, again. Welcome to
the first section of this course.
In the next few lessons,
we'll be exploring the foundations
of BI dashboards and how
they're different from some other kinds
of data analytics dashboards.
We'll also discover many reasons why
dynamic visualizations are an excellent way
to answer business questions,
especially when the answers to
those questions change over time.
You'll learn how a dashboard's interactivity
empowers the stakeholders who you're building it for.
Also, we'll get into
the specific steps to take while planning a dashboard.
To do this, you'll even get to create your own mockup,
an essential step in dashboard building.
Finally, you'll cover the tools you might
use to build BI visualizations in a professional setting.
If you haven't already,
you'll get set up with Tableau,
the visualization tool you'll be using in this course.
The next few lessons,
we'll lay the foundation for your dashboard journey.
I hope you're as excited as I am to get started. 


## Data visualization in business intelligence

You probably know that data visualization is the graphical representation of data.
Maybe you've even had some experience creating charts, graphs and
other types of data visualizations.
If you've earned your Google Data Analytics Certificate, you explored many
key data viz concepts, including accessibility and design thinking.
If you'd like, feel free to spend some time going over these lessons again before
moving forward.
So, you have some familiarity with data visualization.
But did you know that data analytics visualizations are not exactly the same as
business intelligence visualizations? In many ways, they're pretty similar.
Both are visual representations of data that communicate insights to the people
who interpret them.
They aim to share data in a clear and easy-to-digest manner.
However, they differ in context.
A DA visualization aims to answer a business question, such as,
"How is our company revenue trending this year?"
This chart uses only existing data. A BI visualization, on the other hand,
seeks to answer that question in the long term.
So, BI Professionals might ask: "How is revenue trending year over year?" and
"What other metrics related to revenue might indicate an upcoming change in
revenue trends?"
A BI visualization tracks, or
monitors, data that is relevant to an ongoing business question.
This means that sometimes it's built for data that doesn't even exist yet.
In addition, the insights that come from a DA visualization would typically be used
to make an important business decision.
However, BI visualizations are used to make one decision now, but
then another decision in the future,
as the track data updates and lends new insights. In this way, BI visualizations
are generally more dynamic than static, which means they are interactive, or
change over time. When creating a dashboard,
a BI Professional takes a different approach than a data analyst would.
This is because their work goes beyond building and
designing the dashboard to also maintaining it as time goes on.
Here's an example: say a BI Professional at an airline designed a dashboard for
stakeholders who want to monitor new airplane demand over the next 10 years.
They include six different chart types, so
the users can easily identify important metrics and KPIs related to consumers'
travel frequency, the useful product life cycle of airplanes, demand for
new crafts, and lots more.
But perhaps something in the industry changes.
The stakeholders might ask for new KPIs,
different arrangements of visual elements, or similar updates.
It's the BI professional's job to interpret their requests,
determine if they're reasonable and feasible, and implement them into the dash.
In this way, the dashboard keeps informing decisions, solving problems, and
answering key questions for the long term. As you've learned,
the ability to proactively respond to change and
remain continuously useful is an essential part of BI.
Next time we'll go deeper into empowering stakeholders with data visualizations! 


## Empower stakeholders

As a BI professional,
you will build tools that monitor and
showcase important business data.
As you're learning the main purpose
of tracking this data and building it into
a dashboard is to enable
stakeholders to answer their own data questions.
At its core a dashboard is a tool.
For example, a dashboard that tracks
annual revenue can tell you a story about
how a small business went viral
overnight or a dashboard monitoring
the global marketplace can tell you that
competition has increased in a particular market.
The stories told by dashboards provide
important information about what's
currently happening with the company's data,
then these stories provide opportunities for action.
Maybe a company facing
new competition now knows that it needs
to introduce a new product line
or improve an existing one,
and visualizations are more helpful than just raw data
because they help make the data insights
far more clear and understandable.
Sometimes a significant trend might be nearly
impossible to identify without a visualization.
For example, in this spreadsheet about
a company's international sales all of the data is here,
but its meaning is not immediately apparent.
On the other hand, a dashboard about this data
can much more clearly represent what's going on.
After all the primary purpose of
a dashboard isn't just to be aesthetically pleasing,
it's to answer a question or solve a problem.
Imagine that you need to find
a company's total sales for the year 2019.
This chart from a dashboard
answers that question very simply.
You can easily find the data point for
the total of 2019 sales.
Dashboards are also interactive making
them extremely flexible tools that
put the power in the user's hands.
A dashboard doesn't answer
one question and then lose its usefulness,
instead it can answer multiple questions based
on what the user is searching
for and how it's being used.
Going back to our example.
Maybe a stakeholder wants to
use the dashboard to find out
which country has the greatest total sales
across all years.
They can simply change the setting
from within the dashboard environment to
focus on different data
or the same data in a different way.
By creating and maintaining a multifunctional tool,
BI professionals can reduce
the amount of work people need to do.
Instead of building 10 separate charts
to answer 10 questions,
just one interactive dashboard does the job.
As you know, your stakeholders use the tools you
build to make informed business decisions.
Your role as a BI professional will rarely
involve interpreting the data
that your dashboard displays,
instead, you'll create a dash that
empowers users to interpret the data on their own.
You'll determine what the dashboard needs to do,
build the appropriate tool,
and maintain and improve on it over time.
Coming up, we'll investigate more about
stakeholder goals and create
a mockup from a dashboard plan.
You'll soon be on your way to
planning for the perfect dash. 


## Dashboard examples

You have been learning about how dashboards monitor and showcase important business data. In business intelligence, the main purpose of tracking this data and building it into a dashboard is to enable stakeholders to answer their own data questions. If you completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, then you might remember the three types of dashboards discussed in that program: strategic, operational, and analytic. In this reading, you will review all three of these dashboards and how they might be used in a BI context.

- Types of Dashboards

Often, BI professionals will tailor a dashboard for a specific purpose. The three most common categories are:

1. Strategic: focuses on long-term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics

2. Operational: tracks short-term performance and intermediate goals

3. Analytic: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets

- Strategic dashboards

A wide range of businesses use strategic dashboards when evaluating and aligning their strategic goals. These dashboards provide information over the longest time frame—from a single financial quarter to years. They typically contain information that is useful for enterprise-wide decision-making. For example, a strategic dashboard could focus on key performance indicators over a year.

< A dashboard titled Revenue and Customer Overview Q1. Compares revenue from the previous year and the number of new customers >

- Operational dashboards

Operational dashboards are arguably the most common type of dashboard. Because these dashboards contain information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months, they can provide performance insight almost in real-time. This enables businesses to track and maintain their immediate operational processes in light of their strategic goals. An operational dashboard could focus on customer service team performance.

< The Customer Service Team Dashboard includes statistics comparing customer questions answered versus unresolved >

- Analytic dashboards

Analytic dashboards contain the details involved in the use, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists. Data science teams usually create and maintain the most technical category, analytic dashboards. An example of an analytic dashboard could focus on metrics for a company’s financial performance.

< A Financial Performance Dashboard with charts exploring return on assets, wrong capital ratio, and a total balance sheet >

- Key takeaways

As a BI professional, you will often be creating dashboards to help empower stakeholders with access to data they need to answer questions, solve problems, and make decisions. Recognizing the different types of dashboards can help you create tools that are tailored to your organization’s needs and that answer the specific business requirements.



# PRODUCE A DASHBOARD

## Plan a dashboard using mockups

Like any important professional endeavor,
dashboards require a lot of planning to get right.
They also require a lot of collaboration.
You've already worked on many aspects of BI planning,
including a stakeholder requirements document, a project requirements document,
and a strategy document.
In this video, we're going to learn more about planning and
gain some strategies for dashboards specifically.
Typically, a BI professional works with their stakeholders to figure out what
needs to be included in the dash.
The process usually begins with a stakeholder describing their needs.
For example, a sales or
marketing executive may want a dashboard that tracks customer spending habits.
They could ask for visualizations that demonstrate how often customers
buy the same product again, or how much revenue increases at peak shopping times,
such as during certain holidays.
After stakeholders explain their needs,
a BI professional follows up with their own questions.
This helps determine the level of detail involved.
Some questions I like to ask are: What's the dashboard supposed to do?
And what KPIs and dimensions is it tracking?
It's helpful to also ask who the dashboard is being built for.
Is it someone who needs the most specific level of detail or
someone who just needs high-level insights?
Lastly, the BI professional must consider where to find the necessary data and
the timeline it should represent. 

Of course, there are a limitless number of questions that can help shed light about
any given project.
As you continue to gain context, you might identify some gaps in your understanding
or find some pain points that you, and even the stakeholders, weren't expecting.
Following up on these new discoveries will help you ensure you address your
stakeholder's needs more directly and create an effective tool for them to use.
In addition to asking questions,
many BI professionals will observe their stakeholders at work.
This can be actually sitting alongside them at their workstations or
sharing their screens in order to demonstrate a particular workflow.
This is extremely helpful because, often, a stakeholder is so close to their own
processes that they won't notice where or how a dashboard can help them.
This exercise requires time, but it yields a ton of great insights.
Likewise, it's valuable to iterate alongside your stakeholders.
We talk about iteration a lot in BI.
As a refresher, this just means repeating a procedure over and
over again in order to keep getting closer to the desired result.
And as you've learned, desired results are always changing,
which is why BI professionals iterate all the time.
The first step of the dashboard iteration process is to create a low-fidelity
mockup.
A low-fidelity mockup is a simple draft of a visualization that is used for
planning a dashboard and evaluating its progress.
It may be a pen-and-paper model of how it's organized, or
a dashboard with a very limited amount of data.
The stakeholder provides feedback, which you act on.
Sharing a low-fidelity mockup is an excellent way to include your stakeholders
and make the most of your collaboration.
Also, it's very effective at avoiding potential errors.
If you make an assumption that turns out to be incorrect, the mockup can help
you and your users identify it and implement the necessary fixes.
Soon, we'll explore even more about dashboard planning.
After all, the best way to reach a goal is with a clear and thoughtful plan. 


## ACTIVITY: Desing a data visualization mockup

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a low-fidelity mockup based on a scenario. This will help you practice preparing to build a dashboard.

Making a mockup can help you narrow down general visual details of your dashboard. When you share your mockup with your stakeholder, you can get early feedback before you invest a lot of time making a more detailed digital tool. 

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

A private medical practice asks you to create a dashboard to help them better understand their patients. Specifically, they want to know more about patient retention and how they can best serve their patients’ medical needs.

Your contact at the private practice wants to answer the following questions:

    What is the frequency of visits from returning patients? For example, how many times do the same patients visit in a year? How many times do the same patients visit in five years?

    What is the average length of time between visits per patient?

    How many patients are visiting a specialist for a specific condition? How does their visit frequency differ from patients who are only at the practice for general visits and aren’t visiting a specialist?

    What are the results of the five-question surveys that patients are asked to complete after each visit? How many patients complete them? Do the patients who complete them have anything in common?

Considering that the goal of the dashboard is to help improve the way this practice treats its patients, draw a low-fidelity mockup to represent the visual approach you’d take. 

- Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

To get started, get a piece of paper and a pencil. Although you can make a mockup in a drawing program like MS Paint or Adobe Illustrator, many BI pros recommend starting with non-digital tools. Using paper and a pencil allows you to make drawings quickly and move on to new ideas faster. Paper prototypes can feel more flexible, so they can encourage you to be more creative and explore many approaches.

Begin drawing an idea for how you want to arrange your dashboard. Use the details from the scenario to guide your thought process. What you focus on in your mockup might depend on the details your stakeholders share with you. 

If two questions can be answered with the same data, you might position their visualizations close to one another. You could also use a funnel format in your mockup by representing the main takeaways in the largest chart at the top, then going into further detail, or “funneling,” in the following charts.

Draw at least one more mockup on another piece of paper. Even if you are very confident in the layout of your first mockup, try another approach. Challenge yourself to explore as much as possible during the mockup stage of creating a dashboard. The more drafts you create, the more feedback you can get from a stakeholder.

Scan or take photos of your mockups. In your job, you might work remotely or be unable to visit your stakeholder in person. In this case, you’ll need to digitize your paper prototypes. You can recreate them in a digital drawing program, but keep in mind that this can become time-consuming if you create lots of sketches during your mockup brainstorming stage.

Building a mockup is part of the planning phase. While creating your mockup, you might find you don’t have enough information and think of questions to follow up with your stakeholder. These questions should be about anything that seems incomplete in the scenario notes, such as “Is there a number of charts you expect me to create?” or “What kind of chart should I use to represent the average time between visits?” 

Beneath your mockup or on the back of your piece of paper, write 2–3 follow-up questions about this scenario that could help you improve your mockup.
What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed mockups: 

    At least one drawn (paper and pencil or digitally illustrated) mockup

    At least four charts or visuals in each mockup to represent the four main requests from the stakeholder

    Write 2–3 follow-up questions to your stakeholder


### Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

_Note: The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the activity. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that your mockup sketch outlines a visualization to answer the stakeholder’s requests in this activity._

Mockups are personal tools that you share with a stakeholder. They should have clear, bold details and be easy to understand. You don’t need to spend time defining color schemes, fonts, or other kinds of visual style. This should just be the first instance of translating your business needs into a visual representation. Your mockups don’t need to be perfect. They just need to communicate your intentions.

Mockups focus on the arrangement of objects and the contents of each object. An example of the level of detail it should include is “This big chart will go on the top of the main page. It will be a bar chart that represents the frequency of patient visits. Next to it will be this chart, which answers the question about the time between each visit.”

Mockups can include annotations, but they should feature minimal text overall. The majority of your details should go in your planning docs.

In this activity’s scenario, your contact at the private practice wants to answer the following questions:

    What is the frequency of visits from returning patients?

    What is the average length of time between visits per patient and/or diagnosis?

    How many patients are being treated for a specific condition? How does their visit frequency differ from patients who only need general visits?

    What are the results of the five-question surveys that patients are asked to complete after each visit?

In this mockup example, the following section of the dashboard includes interactive filters that stakeholders can use to view data at various timescales. 

< A section of a medical dashboard with filters to refine searches by time, location, specialty, and patient. >

The next section includes key metrics that interest the stakeholder, such as the number of total patients, the average wait time between visits, and the available staff during that period of time. These metrics include arrows that indicate whether the metric has risen or fallen since the previous time period. It also includes a chart that compares the number of new and returning visits over time, the average time between visits for general patients and specific diagnoses, and the number of patients visiting each medical specialty. These three charts answer the first three business questions.

< A section of a medical dashboard with charts visualizing data. There are score cards, a bar chart, and patient metrics. >

The following section features features a pie chart that demonstrates the results of the five-question patient survey. It also lists the percentage of respondents who selected each answer for each question. This section answers the final question in the scenario.

< A section of a medical dashboard with a pie chart and survey results. >

- Key takeaways

Mockups are a helpful way to plan your BI visualizations. In many cases, they are an essential tool that you can use to communicate your design intentions to your stakeholders. They can help you receive helpful feedback so that you can create the most effective visualization for your client. Later in this course, you’ll create mockups as you work on more complex BI visualization projects.


## Dashboard missteps and how to avoid them

If you don't properly plan before creating a dashboard, it's only common sense
that you might make mistakes. But what kinds of problems can occur. In this video,
we will explore some of the most common consequences of not
adequately planning for a dashboard.
There are three main types of dashboard issues that BI professionals encounter.
Put simply, they are data problems, tool problems, and audience problems.
Let's consider each of these more closely.
First, when it comes to a BI dashboard,
a data problem is an issue caused by the data being used that's in the dashboard.
Maybe you've included more data than you need just as you've discovered with
pipelines.
This can cause dashboards to run slowly.
On the other hand, if you don't include enough data, you might be missing crucial
information that your stakeholders could really benefit from having.
Perhaps you incorporated incorrect data sets or data from the wrong time period.
This can cause your stakeholders to come to inaccurate conclusions.
And if you don't understand what data is actually available, you might waste
time and resources trying to obtain data that isn't there. Avoiding data
problems requires you to be very specific before you begin building any BI tool.
Some key points to consider include making sure you know what data should be
displayed and where that data should come from.
Also set up a plan for how you will access the data and
import it into your dashboard. And confirm that you have permission to
access the data and you know what file type you'll use.
Now let's explore tool problems.
These are dashboard issues involving the hardware or software being used.
The most basic type of tool
problem is simply selecting the wrong tool.
As you know, each company uses particular coding languages and
data visualization programs. And
in most cases, the BI professional must use their organization's preferred tools.
As you've been learning, many of the skills you apply to one tool easily transfers to
another. But you still need to understand how these tools are different so
you can navigate them effectively.
Other tool problems relate to processing limitations.
Some programs or
servers may become overwhelmed if they're tracking too many KPIs. Sometimes,
they can even crash if too many people are making edits to the same visualization.
If you run into a hardware limitation during your building phase,
you may need to reduce the project scope or find a more creative solution, which
you will learn more about later on in this course.
Okay, finally, we have audience problems.
These are dashboard issues caused by failing to adequately consider the needs
of the user.
For instance, imagine you're tasked with creating a dashboard for
a company's human resources team.
The tool needs to keep track of how many employees the company has hired, or
will hire, and how many have resigned.
If your dashboard also includes financial and operational metrics, these won't be
relevant to your audience and may clutter the dash causing complexity or confusion.
Which means your tool won't be as helpful to stakeholders as it could be. Another
kind of audience problem concerns privacy and permissions.
It's your responsibility to ensure that your dashboard only includes information
that the users are permitted to access, rather than something sensitive or
private.
It's especially important to consider the needs of different audiences when you're
building a single dashboard for multiple users. For example,
say you're creating a dash to be used by a company's marketing team across Africa,
Asia, and Europe, as well as by the chief marketing officer.
The CMO would need data about all regions, where the regional teams
may only require access to their own data.
In this case, you would configure the privacy settings to account for
multiple permissions.
Later on, you'll learn more about how privacy permissions work,
but for now you've explored some of the most common problems
that occur when building dashboards.
More importantly, you understand how to avoid them.
And being proactive is an essential skill for any BI professional. 


## Refresh your Tableau skills

You've been investigating
various BI visualization tools and how they
may have different user interfaces
or UIs and workstreams.
In this video, we'll
learn more about the different tools you
might use to visualize data and create dashboards,
as well as how your skills in
one program can transfer to another.
As you know, BI visualization tools enable you to
visually represent the data you
collect and prepare for a dashboard.
With some programs, you can transform
data and make a dashboard using the same software.
Others are specifically dedicated to
visualization and have
limited functionality for transformation.
In this course, we'll be working in Tableau most often.
It's a powerful visual
analytics platform that enables you
to create BI dashboards and data visualizations.
Tableau is used by many industry experts,
and has a straightforward and friendly UI.
If you earned your Google data analytics certificate,
you already have some experience with Tableau.
To prepare for what's to come,
feel free to take some time to review those lessons.
Some other programs you might use as a BI
professional include Google Data Studio,
Looker, and Power BI.
Let's explore them briefly now.
Google Data Studio is
a reporting tool that's all about simplicity.
It focuses more on reporting than data transformation,
but it can still be used to create
a variety of dashboards.
Looker is a data aggregation and
dashboarding tool similar to Tableau.
It uses its own modeling language called Look ML.
Power BI is Microsoft's dashboarding and reporting tool,
which is similar to Tableau.
Some of its functions may offer
different capabilities depending on
the volume of data you're working with.
These programs behave fairly similarly.
You may use any of these tools to
complete the activities in this course.
But keep in mind that most of the instructions will be
tailored to Tableau's UI and functionality.
If you do choose to work in another program,
you may need to take additional or different steps
to finish the tasks.
To start, in the next activity,
you will set up your Tableau public account.
Tableau public is a free platform to explore,
create, and publicly shared data visualizations online.
You can use it to perform most of
Tableau's functions on any operating system at no cost.
The second activity is optional.
In it, you can download
the Tableau public desktop
edition application to your computer.
While in browser functionality is nearly identical,
some may prefer the desktop version.
Because it is only available with Windows and MacOS,
it is not required to complete this course.
Tableau public desktop does have
functions that the in-browser Tableau public does not.
For example it enables you to use
Tableau without an Internet connection.
But again, it's not required to
complete the activities in this course.
One important thing to keep in mind is that
these programs are constantly being updated and refined.
They might appear differently as changes are made.
If this happens, take
the opportunity to troubleshoot the issue yourself.
This is excellent practice for actual business
scenarios you'll encounter a lot as a BI professional?
You can hone your skills as a data detective
as you practice the art of trial and error.
If you truly get stuck,
you can always refer to the programs,
help resources, our forums,
and the programs customer support.
One last thing, when you
create your Tableau public account,
remember that potential employers can view
your public profile as part of your work portfolio.
This is helpful to remember
after you've completed this program.
Tableau also has a feature where you can let
potential employers know you're available for hire.
This can be enabled by checking the available
for hire box on your Tableau public profile. 


## Visualization tool resources

As a business intelligence professional, you will work with a variety of visualization tools. One of the great things about BI and the online community is that there are a lot of resources available to help you. The following resource list has some tips for working with Tableau and a few other tools.

- Tableau resources

Additionally, you might be interested in learning more about other BI visualization tools. That’s great! There are a lot of BI visualization tools you might want to add to your toolbox. Here are some additional resources to help you get started:

1. Learn Looker Studio: Looker Studio Support connects you to access a variety of tutorials focused on using Looker.

2. Looker Studio templates: If you’re interested in using Looker Studio, there is a selection of premade templates you can use to get started creating visualizations and dashboards.  

3. MicroStrategy demos: MicroStrategy hosts a collection of demonstrations to help you use their tool system for a variety of applications.


## Balance tool limitations and user expectations

So far in this program, you have learned a lot about available business intelligence tools and how you can use them as a BI professional. These tools will help you to monitor incoming data, generate visualizations and dashboards, and empower stakeholders with access to reports. This helps stakeholders make informed decisions.

These tools also have limitations. They may not be able to process complex demands fast enough or generate complicated visualizations with a lot of metrics. In this reading, you’ll have an opportunity to review strengths and limitations of business intelligence tools.

- Tool performance

Coming up, you are going to learn more about what affects tool performance. But for now, there are three elements you should keep in mind:

1. The scope of a project: How much time needs to be represented in the dashboard? The longer the timeline, the more data needs to be processed and presented.

2. The complexity of the metrics: How many key performance indicators need to be captured by the dashboard? The more complex your metrics, the more processing speed is affected.

3. The processing speed of your tool: How fast can your tools actually respond to requests? The more requests, the more burden is placed on the system, which can slow down response times.

- Comparing common tools

_Tool    /    Strengths    /    Limitations_

As a BI professional, part of your job will be considering tool limitations, as well as what affects a tool's performance and how to balance technological requirements with stakeholder needs. Continuing to think about tool limitations and user expectations will help you develop the best possible solutions for your projects, no matter what the requirements may be.


## Take a tour of Tableau

You have started exploring Tableau as a data visualization tool in business intelligence dashboards to convey insights with stakeholders. Throughout this program, you will continue to use and access Tableau—eventually using it to create your own dashboards. This reading will enable you to familiarize yourself with Tableau's interface and functionality.

- Create a profile on Tableau Public

With Tableau Public, you can create and share visualizations. If you don’t already have an account, make one on the Tableau Public site. Note that trying to make an account from the main page will sign you up for a Tableau Free Trial rather than a Tableau Public account.

< Tableau Public sign-up page >

The difference between these two options is that a Free Trial lasts for 14 days, whereas Tableau Public gives you long-term access through the web version of the program. It has some limitations compared to the other versions of Tableau, but it is free to use and will enable you to complete the upcoming activities. You can also use your Tableau credentials to access Tableau Public if you already have an account! You are welcome to try the free trial or purchase Tableau, but it is not required for this program.

Complete the information in the signup form. When you click the Create My Profile button, you’ll be transferred to your profile page. This is where your Tableau Public visualizations can be made public to share with your peers. In the tabs on this page, you can access lists of visualizations you’ve made, visualizations you’ve favorited, authors you are following, and authors who are following you. By clicking Edit Profile, you can add additional information like your bio, title, organization, and links to social media accounts. This is also where you can enable Tableau Public’s Hire Me Button. The Hire Me Button will indicate to potential hiring managers that your Tableau skills are available for hire.

- Optional: Download the desktop version

With the desktop application, you can use features from Tableau Public without connecting to the internet. It is free to use, just like Tableau Public’s online version. Keep in mind that this application cannot be used on the Chromebook operating system and is not required for this course. If you are using Windows or Mac OS, this desktop application will enable you to complete upcoming activities that use Tableau Public. To download Tableau Public Desktop Edition (this is optional), log into your account and review the system requirements for your operating system.

- Loading and linking data

Tableau enables you to load in your own data and link it to other datasets directly in the platform. When you log in, choose to Create a Viz. This will open a new worksheet where you can upload data or connect to online sources, such as your Google Drive.

Once you upload data to your worksheet, it will populate the Connections pane.

You can add more connections to other data sources in order to build visualizations that compare different datasets. Simply drag and drop tables from the Sheets section in order to join tables and generate those connections.

- Dimensions and measures

Tableau uses dimensions and measures to generate customized charts. For example, check out this chart focusing on CO2 emissions per country. The Country Name dimension can be used to show a map of the countries on the planet with dots indicating which countries are represented in the data.

The dots are all the same size because—with no measure selected—Tableau defaults to scale each country equally. If you want to scale by CO2 emissions, you need to include a specific measure. Here is the same chart with a measure for CO2 kiloton (kt). This changes the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted.

Tableau has a wide variety of options for depicting the measure for a given dimension. Most of these options are contained near the main display and the column with dimensions and measures.

Tableau allows you to customize measures with options such as Color, Size, and Label, which change those aspects of the measure’s visualization on the chart. As you customize measures in Tableau, you will want to consider accessibility for your audience. As a refresher, you can check out this video on accessible visualizations from the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.

- Types of visualizations in Tableau

In addition to more traditional charts, Tableau also offers some more specific visualizations that you can use in your dashboard design:

1. Highlight tables appear like tables with conditional formatting. Review the steps to build a highlight table.

2. Heat maps show intensity or concentrations in the data. Review the steps to build a heat map.

3. Density maps illustrate concentrations (such as a population density map). Refer to instructions to create a heat map for density.

4. Gantt charts demonstrate the duration of events or activities on a timeline. Review the steps to build a Gantt chart.

6. Symbol maps display a mark over a given longitude and latitude. Learn more from this example of a symbol map.

7. Filled maps are maps with areas colored based on a measurement or dimension. Explore an example of a filled map.

8. Circle views show comparative strength in data. Learn more from this example of a circle view.

9. Box plots, also known as box and whisker charts, illustrate the distribution of values along a chart axis. Refer to the steps to build a box plot.

10. Bullet graphs compare a primary measure with another and can be used instead of dial gauge charts. Review the steps to build a bullet graph.

11. Packed bubble charts display data in clustered circles. Review the steps to build a packed bubble chart.

# REVIEW: DATA ANALYTICS CONTENT

## Data visualization

Welcome back, future data analyst!
As a budding analyst, you'll be exposed to a lot of data.
People learn and absorb data in so many different ways, and
one of the most effective ways that this can happen is through visualization.
Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data.
In reality, it's just putting information into an image to make it easier for
other people to understand.
If you've ever looked at any kind of map, whether it's paper or online,
then you know exactly how helpful visuals can be.
Data visualizations are definitely having a moment right now.
Online, we are surrounded by images that show information in all kinds of ways.
But the history of data visualization goes back way further than the web.
Visualizing data began long ago with maps,
which are the visual representation of geographic data.
This map of the known world is from 1502.
Map makers continued to improve their visualizations as new lands were charted,
new data was collected about those locations, and new methods for
visualizing the data were created.
Scientists and mathematicians began to truly embrace the idea of arranging
data visually in the 1700s and 1800s.
This bar graph is from 1821, and
it doesn't look too different from bar graphs that we see today.
But since the beginning of the digital age of data analytics in the 1990s,
the scope and
reach of visualizations have grown along with the data they graphically represent.
As we keep learning how to more efficiently communicate with visuals,
the quality of our insights continue to grow too.
Today, we can quantify human behavior through data, and
we've learned to use computers to collect, analyze, and visualize that data.
As an analyst in today's world,
you'll probably split your time with data visuals in two ways:
Looking at visuals in order to understand and
draw conclusions about data, or creating visuals from raw data to tell a story.
Either way, it's always good to keep in mind that data visualizations will be
your key to success.
This is especially true once you reach the point where you're ready to present
the results of your data analysis to an audience.
Getting people to understand your vision and thought process can feel challenging,
but a well-made data visualization has the power to change people's minds.
Plus, it can help someone who doesn't have the same technical background or
experience as you form their own opinions.
So here's a quick rule for creating a visualization.
Your audience should know exactly what they're looking at within the first five
seconds of seeing it.
Basically, this means the visual should be clear and easy to follow.
And the five seconds after that, your audience should understand the conclusion
your visualization is making, even if they aren't totally familiar with the research
you've been doing. They might not agree with your conclusion and that's okay.
You can always use their feedback to adjust your visualization and
go back to the data to do further analysis.
So now let's talk about what we have to do to create a visualization that's
understandable, effective, and, most importantly, convincing.
Let's start from the beginning.
Data visualizations are a helpful tool for
fitting a lot of information into a small space. To do this,
you first need to structure and organize your thoughts. Think about your objectives
and the conclusions you've reached after sorting through data. Then, think
about the patterns you've noticed in the data, the things that surprised you, and,
of course, how all of this fits together into your analysis.
Identifying the key elements of your findings
helps set the stage for how you should organize your presentation.
Check out this data visualization made by David McCandless,
a well known data journalist.
This graphic includes four key elements the information or
data, the story, the goal, and the visual form.
It's arranged in a four-part Venn diagram which tells us that
all four elements are needed for a successful visualization. So far,
you've learned a lot about the data using visualizations.
That's important because it's a key building block for your visualization.
The story or concept adds meaning to the data and makes it interesting.
We'll talk more about the importance of data storytelling later.
But for now just remember that the story and the data combined provide
an outline of what you're trying to show. The goal or function
makes the data both useful and usable. And the visual form creates both beauty and
structure. With just two elements you can create a rough sketch of a visual.
This could work if you're at an early stage but won't give you a complete
visualization because you'd be missing other key elements.
Even using three elements gets you closer, but you're not quite finished.
For example, if you combined information, goal, and visual form without any story,
your visual probably look fine but it won't be interesting. On their own,
each element has value, but visualizations only become truly powerful and
effective when you combine all four elements in a way that makes sense.
And when you think about all these elements together,
you can create something meaningful for your audience. At Google,
I make sure to develop visualizations to tell stories about data that include
all four of these elements. And
I can tell you that each element is a key to a visualization success.
That's why it's so important for you, as the analysts, to pay close attention to
each element as we move forward. Other people might not know or
understand the exact steps you took to come to the conclusions you've made, but
that shouldn't stop them from understanding your reasoning.
Basically, an effective data visualization should lead viewers to reach the same
conclusion you did, but much more quickly. Because of the age we live in,
we're constantly being shown different ways to view and absorb information.
This means that you've already seen lots of visuals
you can reference as you design your own visualizations. You have the power to tell
convincing stories that can change opinions and shift mindsets.
That's pretty cool.
But you also have the responsibility to pay attention to the perspectives of
others as you create these stories.
So it's important to always keep that in mind. Coming up,
we'll start drawing connections between data and
images to create a strong foundation for your visual masterpieces.
I can't wait to get started.
