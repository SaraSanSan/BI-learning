# | Decisions: DASHBOARDS & REPORTS |

# COURSE 3: END-OF-COURSE PROJECT

You’ll finish working on your portfolio project by building a BI dashboard. You’ll refer to key BI documents to create a low-fidelity mockup, design charts, and organize your dashboard. Your portfolio artifacts will include a mockup and a working dashboard, which will be ready to present to stakeholders.

Learning Objectives:

    Present a end-to-end business intelligence case study through a complete portfolio
    Apply knowledge of business intelligence, data pipelines, and dashboards
    Develop a dashboard in Tableau


## Welcome to module 5

Throughout this program
you've developed essential skills in business intelligence.
You also learned about the importance
of building a portfolio that demonstrates your abilities
and accomplishments.
Now it's time to return to your end-of-course project.
In earlier courses, you worked
on a BI project that you can showcase in your portfolio.
You created key BI documents
and a data pipeline to practice producing deliverables
for a business scenario.
From these projects,
you now have fully usable data
that you can visualize in a dashboard.
In this course
you learned how to plan, build, and present dashboards.
Equipped with these new skills,
you can now complete your end-of-course project.
Now, you'll load those reporting tables
into a visualization software
to highlight important insights with a BI dashboard.
You'll continue to track your approach, methods,
accomplishments, and transferable skills
so that you can add this information to your portfolio.
When you finish this step of the project
you will have a complete end-to-end business
intelligence case study.
This will help you demonstrate your BI knowledge
during interviews and networking opportunities
which will be essential to landing your first BI job.
Future employers
and business contacts will understand how hard
you worked to develop your skills.
As you begin this project, know
that you can go at your own pace.
You can always refer to the lessons and resources
in this program if you face a challenge or need help.
And remember, collaborating with others
in the discussion forums is a great way
to brainstorm solutions.
Get ready for the next
and final step of your end-of-course project! 



# APPLY YOUR SKILLS TO A WORKPLACE SCENARIO

## Complete your end-of-course project

Hello!
Now it's time to wrap up
your business intelligence end-of-course project.
So far, you've completed
your key BI documents, data pipeline,
and reporting tables from previous courses.
If you haven't finished these,
you can take some time
to wrap up your work on those deliverables
to be ready for this next stage.
Otherwise, you can use the exemplars provided
for these projects
to build your upcoming visualizations.
With your reporting tables ready
to load into a visualization tool, such as Tableau,
you're ready to move forward on your project.
You'll start with creating a mockup,
then you'll create your charts
and organize them into a dashboard.
Finally, you'll develop your unique presentation style
you can use when sharing the dashboard in your portfolio.
The project is structured in this order,
but as always, you can go at your own pace
and in the way you choose.
You can read through the materials,
and then go straight from a mockup to a dashboard
and then return to chart design specifics.
You can even alternate back and forth
between each step of the process.
Work in a way that fits your style.
Your dashboard artistry is completely your own.
If you did the activities in this course,
you've already completed each of these steps.
None of this material will be new to you,
and if you get stuck, you can review previous lessons.
This project continues the work
that you started in previous courses.
You'll use the skills you mastered along the way
to guide you through the process.
This will allow you to make your own BI decisions
and develop your skills independently
so that you'll be ready
when you encounter BI projects in the workplace.
Once again, the readings in this section
will contain the scenario for the case study,
the business questions you need to answer,
and the instructions
for what kind of visualizations you'll need to build.
Now, it's time to get started.
Read through the case study materials,
decide how to best design your dashboard,
and create your project and presentation
in the visualization tool you choose.
When you finish,
you'll have your very own completed case study
to show off to prospective employers.
Enjoy working on your portfolio. 



# CYCLISTIC SCENARIO

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a visualization for the Cyclistic end-of-course project! You will use your project planning documents and completed target table to build a BI visualization tool.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the activity. As a reminder, the end-of-course project activities will be more open to interpretation than other activities in this program to give you an opportunity to practice the skills you have been learning. If you need help or feel stuck, you can always discuss your work with other learners in the discussion forums or review the exemplar to help guide your process.

The product development team at Cyclistic has begun developing their business plan for next year. In order to build a better Cyclistic, the team needs to understand how customers are currently using the bikes, how location and other factors impact demand, and what stations get the most traffic. The Cyclistic team has a few goals:

    Understand what customers want, what makes a successful product, and how new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas
    
    Understand how the current line of bikes are used
    
    Apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth
    
    Understand how different users (subscribers and non-subscribers) use the bikes

You met with stakeholders to complete project planning documents, uploaded the necessary tables into your project space, and observed the team in action to better understand how they use the data. Now, it’s time to visualize the data to make a dashboard tool for Cyclistic’s team.

- Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the question at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

The first step is load your data into Tableau.

In the previous course, you created a data pipeline that brought three public datasets into a reporting table. Now, open your reporting table in Tableau to begin building your visualizations.You can do this by uploading the .csv or .xlsx file that you generated in the previous activity of the end-of-course project. Or, you can connect Tableau directly to Google Cloud. To learn more about this, check out the Google BigQuery guide on Tableau Help. Note: This functionality might not work properly in Tableau Public.

Now, create a low fidelity mockup to help you plan the components and layout of your dashboard. Your mockup should include sketch versions of the charts and other visual elements you wish to include in your dashboard.

If necessary, create multiple mockups to brainstorm the best way to build your dashboard. The more thought you put into your mockup, the easier it will be to build your dashboard later.

_If you need more practice creating a low fidelity mockup, refer to the activity about designing a mockup._

Next, create the charts that you will include in your visualization. Pay close attention to the project goals outlined in your project planning documents. This will ensure that your charts answer your stakeholder’s questions.

_If you need more practice creating BI charts, refer to the activity about creating a chart._

Organize the charts you made into a dashboard. Include any additional visual elements such as filters, captions, titles, links, or tables.

_If you need more practice creating a BI dashboard, refer to the activity about dashboard element layout._

Finally, complete the executive summary document you started in the previous course’s end-of-course project. Your executive summary should describe Cyclistic’s business needs, your project goals, the methods you used to complete each step of the project, and the functionality of your dashboard. It is an important document to help you share your work in your portfolio.

_If you need a refresher on how to complete an executive summary, refer to the reading about creating an executive summary._

Pro Tip: Save your work. Be sure to save the final dashboard and executive summary you created in this activity. Use them in your portfolio as you begin your job search for a BI role. This project will help you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

- What to Include in Your Response

Address the following criteria in your completed dashboard and presentation: 

    A low-fidelity mockup that outlines your dashboard components and layout
    
    Multiple charts and other kinds of visual elements (such as tables, links, captions, etc.)
    
    An executive summary that includes the project goals, your methods, and a description of the capabilities of your dashboard


### Activity Exemplar: Build a dashboard for Cyclistic

- Summer trends

< Maps and tables with filters that visualize seasonal trends of bike trips in each borough of New York City >

The first tab of the dashboard is a map of seasonal trends of bike trips in each of the New York boroughs. The largest map shows each of the boroughs. The table compares the number of trips and average trip duration for customers and subscribers in each neighborhood. Three smaller maps focus on July, August, and September: the three months with the highest bike traffic.

This map features several filters to focus on specific bike IDs, user types, metrics, months, starting neighborhoods, and ending neighborhoods. Using any of these filters or clicking on a borough in one of the maps updates the table and maps to focus on your selection in greater detail.

- Seasonality

< Summary tab of dashboard with Trip Totals and Trip Counts by Start Neighborhood charts >

The second tab of the dashboard focuses on seasonality, or trends throughout the year, with the Trip Totals chart and the Trip Counts by Starting Neighborhood table. 

- Trip Totals chart

< Trip Counts by Starting Neighborhood table >

The Trip Totals chart visualizes the total number of bike trips taken throughout 2019 and 2020, with a distinction between customers and subscribers. This chart shows that subscribers make up a significantly larger portion of Cyclistic’s users than regular customers. It also shows that there are far more users in warmer months (May–October) than there are in colder months. This makes sense considering that people are less likely to ride bicycles in colder weather.

This chart was made by putting the Start Day (aggregated by month) in the columns field, the sum of Trip Counts in the rows filed, and UserType as color assignment.

The Trip Counts by Starting Neighborhood table lists the total number of bike trips started in each neighborhood in each month of 2019 and 2020. It is organized by zip code, borough, and neighborhood. It also uses a color gradient to emphasize the highest and lowest counts of monthly trips. The greater the number of trips, the darker the value is in the table. It also uses light text on the darker values to ensure that the table is readable and accessible.

Because the starting location is more indicative of where users look for a bike, it is more important to emphasize starting location when determining where to advertise. The most active stations are in the Lower East Side and the Chelsea and Clinton neighborhoods. The most active months are from May to October.

This table was created by putting the Start Day dimension (aggregated by Year and Month) in the Columns field, then the Borough Start and Neighborhood Start dimensions in the Rows field. Then, the color and labels can be set by putting the sum of the Trip Count measure into the Color and Label fields.

- Top Trips

< Summary tab of dashboard with comparison of total minutes by starting and ending neighborhood for customers and subscribers >

The third and final tab of the dashboard is a comparison of the total number of trip minutes by starting neighborhood and ending neighborhood for both customers and subscribers. The two charts are horizontal stacked bar graphs that are ordered from highest to lowest number of minutes (between customers and subscribers combined).

These charts lend insight into which locations users are most willing to travel long distances to. The charts show that the Lower East Side and Chelsea and Clinton neighborhoods have the highest total trip minutes for both start and end stations. 

To make the starting neighborhood chart, you can put the sum of Trip Minutes in the columns field, and then the Zip Code Start, Neighborhood Start, and Borough Start dimensions in the rows field. Then, set UserType as the color assignments. To make the ending neighborhood chart, complete the same steps but use the Zip Code End, Neighborhood End, and Borough End dimensions.

- Key insights

This exemplar is only one way to complete the Cyclistic project. When comparing your work to this exemplar, use it as an example to guide your process instead of an ideal to replicate. Make sure to also explore the dashboard on Tableau Public to get a better understanding of its interactive components. Then, finalize your executive summary document so you can share your work on your professional portfolio.



# GOOGLE FIBER SCENARIO

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a dashboard for the Google Fiber end-of-course project! You will use your project planning documents and completed target table to build a BI visualization tool.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the activity. As a reminder, the end-of-course project activities will be more open to interpretation than other activities in this program to give you an opportunity to practice the skills you have been learning. If you need help or feel stuck, you can always discuss your work with other learners in the discussion forums or review the exemplar to help guide your process.

The Google Fiber customer service team’s goal is to determine how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. The dashboard you create should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide your stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. As part of the interview process, you have been asked to create a dashboard that will: 

    Help them understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time

    Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls

    Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities

    Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year. 

You met with stakeholders to complete project planning documents, uploaded the necessary tables into your project space, and created a single reporting table. Now, it’s time to visualize the data to make a dashboard tool for Google Fiber’s customer service team.

- Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the question at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

The first step is load your data into Tableau.

In the previous course, you created a reporting table that merged all three of the tables you were provided. Now, open your reporting table in Tableau to begin building your visualizations.

You can do this by uploading the .csv or .xlsx file that you generated in the previous activity of the end-of-course project. Or, connect Tableau directly to Google Cloud. To learn more about this, refer to the Google BigQuery guide on Tableau Help. Note: This functionality might not work properly in Tableau Public.

Now, create a low fidelity mockup to help you plan the components and layout of your dashboard. Your mockup should include sketch versions of the charts and other visual elements you wish to include in your dashboard.

If necessary, create multiple mockups to brainstorm the best way to build your dashboard. The more thought you put into your mockup, the easier it will be to build your dashboard later.

_If you need more practice creating a low fidelity mockup, refer to the activity about designing a mockup._

Next, create the charts that you will include in your visualization. Pay close attention to the project goals outlined in your project planning documents. This will ensure that your charts answer stakeholder questions.

_If you need more practice creating BI charts, refer to the activity about creating a chart._

Organize the charts you made into a dashboard. Include any additional visual elements such as filters, captions, titles, links, or tables.

_If you need more practice creating a BI dashboard, refer to the activity about dashboard element layout._

Finally, complete the executive summary document you started in the previous course’s end-of-course project. Your executive summary should describe the Google Fiber customer service team’s business needs, your project goals, the methods you used to complete each step of the project, and the functionality of your dashboard. It is an important document to help you share your work in your portfolio.

_If you need a refresher on how to complete an executive summary, refer to the reading about creating an executive summary._

Pro Tip: Save your work. Be sure to save the final dashboard and executive summary you created in this activity. Use them in your portfolio as you begin your job search for a BI role. This project will help you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

- What to Include in Your Response

Address the following criteria in your completed dashboard and presentation: 

    A low-fidelity mockup that outlines your dashboard components and layout

    Multiple charts and other kinds of visual elements (such as tables, links, captions, etc.)

    An executive summary that includes the project goals, your methods, and a description of the capabilities of your dashboard


### Activity Exemplar: Build a dashboard for Google Fiber

- Repeats by Month

< Two tables: Repeats by Month and Day 0 Calls by Day of Week. Visualize monthly and weekly call cadence >

The first tab of the dashboard includes two bar charts: the first chart visualizes the number of repeat calls the customer service team received each month. Contacts_N represents the first date a customer called– then, you can explore how often the customer called again that week. For example, 1,636 customers called again one day after their initial call, but only 575 customers called again seven days later in January. 

The second chart visualized the percentage of first contact calls by day of the week; in January, only 8.71% of customers made first contact on Sunday. The majority of customers reached out for the first time on Monday in January! 

- Tables

< Table tab of the dashboard with two tables: Repeat Calls by First Call Date and Calls by Market and Type. >

The second tab of the dashboard includes two tables: Repeat Calls by First Call Date and Calls by Market and Type.

The first table allows stakeholders to explore the number of different types of calls by date. The second table then separates calls into market and problem type to provide more specific information about what markets experience the most calls and the problems customers have that seem to prompt repeat calls. 

- Market and Type for First Repeat Calls

< Bar chart representing the Market and Type for First Repeat Calls >

The Market and Type for First Repeat Calls uses the data from the previous tabs table in order to further visualize the problem types that seem to generate the most repeat calls for different markets. 

- Calls Across Q1

< Two charts: Day 0 Calls by Market and Type Across Q1 and First Repeat Call by Market and Type Across Q1 >

The final dashboard tab includes two charts to visualize the number of Day 0 calls across markets and problem types and the first repeat calls across markets and problem types. This helps users gain insight into what markets and problems are generating calls in the first quarter of the year, as well as which ones are prompting customers to call again after the first contact. 

- Key insights

This exemplar is only one way to complete the Google Fiber project. When comparing your work to this exemplar, use it as an example to guide your process instead of an ideal to replicate. Make sure to also explore the dashboard on Tableau Public to get a better understanding of its interactive components. Then, finalize your executive summary document so you can share your work on your professional portfolio.



# END-OF-COURSE PROJECT WRAP-UP

## Course wrap-up

Congratulations, you've completed the last component
of your end-of-course project!
This is a huge accomplishment that demonstrates
all your hard work in this program.
You finished this project on your own.
You applied your knowledge of business intelligence,
data pipelines, and dashboards to create something
that truly demonstrates your growth as a BI professional.
You can now include this presentation in your portfolio,
share it with potential employers,
and discuss it during interviews.
Share the presentation materials you made,
the dashboard itself, or the writeup about the process
you used and the choices you made.
Ideally, you'll show all of the above!
Each component illustrates your BI journey.
Now, you've completed the first step toward
your BI career and reached the end of this program.
And don't miss the next section,
which has a special message from some familiar faces
to help you celebrate! 


## Tony: Career-building strategies

My name is Tony and I'm a finance program manager here at google for
the last five years.
I interviewed financial analysts and
a lot of financial assets with a specific focus towards business intelligence and
the thing that makes someone really stand out for me is someone that has really
strong communication skills and has got a really good ability to tell their
story when you're in an interview and you don't have the previous work experience
that demonstrates that you know how to use the tools that you may have learned
in your data certificate of your business intelligence certificate.
This is where as an interview where you really have to just take charge of
the interview.
So take advantage of questions that leave you the opportunity to dive in and
really explain what you've learned and
how you would apply it a lot of times an interviewer like myself,
I'll open up a very generalized question to see where the interview we will go.
Whether they want to work with hard numbers for financial standpoint or
whether they want to take their response and start to talk about how they
would use sequel or python or r as a solution tool and
maybe even carry me through some parts of that process of how they would
go through putting that in place to solve the problem that we're talking about.
That is one really good way to say.
I'm connecting the dots between what I've learned recently in the job that I'm
applying for
without having the professional experience right there on your resume.
One thing that Absolutely and
strongly recommend someone not do is put themselves in a scenario where they
cannot control the environment that is around them in an interview.
So a lot of our interviews right now are being conducted virtually.
It's very important that you're intentional about where you take your
interview.
I had one person one time taking interview out on a street corner outside of a cafe.
Very wrong, having the best as much control about your space as you can.
It's not just for me as the interview were, but it's also for
you as the interview we where you can feel comfortable and confident and
know that you're not going to get distracted in that setting.
One of the things I would really encourage you do is that in advance of the interview
you take a look at all of the different projects and the analysis that you did
through the certificate process, organize a few of them that can be used for
generalized questions now from my perspective as someone who's looking
at entry level folks and I'm really not concerned about the previous experience.
I want to see how you can articulate what you've learned.
And so for me it would be if we can get into a little bit more technical
question in the interview that you lean in on what you've learned during
the certificate program process.
Be confident in what you've learned and know that you've done
enough to put you in the room, so take advantage of that moment. 


## Incorporate your project into your portfolio

Congratulations on completing the last part of your end-of-course project! Now that you have your business intelligence visualization ready to share, you can incorporate what you made into your portfolio.

By now, you’ve created a portfolio where you share your projects with potential employers. You can add the project planning documents, data pipeline code, target table, dashboard, and slide deck presentation you created for this project. 

You might also want to add a written summary of your methods, such as your thought process for how and why you executed your project the way you did. Your written summary should explain your reasoning for each step you took. For example, if you chose a bar chart to visualize a certain metric instead of a line graph, explain why you did that. 

By describing how you think about and successfully solve business problems in a written summary, you demonstrate to potential employers that you are a capable BI professional. A written summary can also serve as a journal so that you can remember your own thought process. You can use it as a resource when you prepare to present your portfolio during an interview.

Each of these items represents important steps in the business intelligence project process, so displaying them in your portfolio will help future employers understand your skills and accomplishments.



# REVIEW: DATA ANALYTICS CONTENT

## Create your online portfolio

This reading provides a checklist about what to include in your portfolio, where you can set up accounts to host your portfolio, and how to add content to your portfolio. 

- What to include

You learned that a portfolio represents your skills and showcases some of your previous projects to potential employers. Keep your portfolio:

    Personal: Show who you are, what you are interested in, and what is important to you.

    Simple: Display your work with easy navigation and without cluttered pages.

    Relevant: Match your work to the skills included in job descriptions.

    Presentable: Emphasize quality in the samples you show.  

    Unique: Showcase your own work; cite sources of content to avoid plagiarism.

- Where to set up accounts

Choose a platform to host your portfolio. Medium, Google Sites, and Wordpress are good for blogging. GitHub and Kaggle are better for code. And finally, as you know, Tableau is great for visualizations. Next, create an account on the platform that you chose. Check out these steps to set up accounts on various platforms: 

	Set up an account on GitHub
	Set up an account on Kaggle
	Set up an account on Tableau Public
	Set up an account on Medium
	Set up an account on WordPress
	Set up a site on Google Sites

- How to add content to your portfolio

Finally, refer to the following table for some links to articles that can help you to manage your portfolio. Articles are free but some sites limit the number of articles you can view per month. In that case, bookmark the article to view it later. 

- Information to help you manage your portfolio

GitHub - 8 steps to publishing your portfolio on GitHub: Follow the steps in this article to create a repository for your portfolio.

Kaggle - Publishing your first dataset on Kaggle: Follow the steps in this article to publish your own dataset and make it public.

Tableau - Any visualization created in Tableau Public is already public by default. A lot more is involved to add a Tableau visualization to another hosted site. For that reason, it is probably best to link to Tableau visualizations when your portfolio is hosted on a personal website or on a different platform, like GitHub.

Medium - Getting started with a Medium publication: Follow the process in this guide to create your own publication.

WordPress - Get Published: Follow these instructions to create pages or post content on your site.

Google Sites - Publish & share your site: Follow these instructions to publish your site and share it publicly.
