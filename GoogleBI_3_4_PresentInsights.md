## Welcome to module 4

As you're discovering, working as a business
intelligence professional involves many technical skills.
These include things like knowing
how to identify the right data,
metrics, and KPIs for a particular project,
applying data modeling and
pipelines to organize and move data,
transforming data into a usable form,
using that data to solve problems and answer questions,
and making visualizations and dashboards
that drive business processes and goals.
But BI also requires
excellent communication and presentation skills.
After all, if you want
your hard work to really make an impact,
it's important to know how to
effectively share it with others.
Successful BI professionals can clearly demonstrate
how the tools they create enable
their clients to meet business objectives.
Plus, this is also
important for your career advancement!
Having strong communication and presentation skills
can help you excel
whether you're interviewing for
a job, discussing a promotion,
or asking a supervisor about
a new training or educational opportunity.
During the next few lessons,
we're going to concentrate on these key workplace skills.
They are an essential complement to
all the technical knowledge that you've
gained so far in this program.
First, you'll explore
stakeholder presentations and
sharing dashboards with clients.
Then, you'll shift your focus to
the BI hiring process and
strategies for refining your portfolio.
In addition, you'll have
the opportunity to update your resume for
the BI field so it clearly
communicates all of your new experiences.
And finally, you'll review
interview techniques that will help
you demonstrate your skills to
recruiters and hiring managers.
Each of these lessons will prepare you to
take your BI career to the next level.
So, let's get moving on your exciting professional journey. 



# COMMUNICATE INSIGHTS TO STAKEHOLDERS

## Present your insights

In this course, you've learned that the steps
of a BI project aren't always linear.
Time passes, problems change,
questions are refined —
there's constant evolution. And presenting and
communicating about project updates
is a key part of this process.
If you earned your Google Data Analytics certificate,
you spent a lot of time learning about
presentation and communication skills.
In that context, you worked on
data storytelling, creating compelling slideshows,
public speaking strategies, responding to
feedback and questions from clients, and more.
In the world of BI, the concept
of presenting is a bit different.
So, let's begin by clarifying
what's meant by "presentation" in BI.
People often think a presentation
has to happen in a conference room.
But many BI presentations are simply email threads.
With this in mind, going forward,
think of a BI presentation
as anytime you communicate with
stakeholders about their needs or project status.
Note that this doesn't include answering questions or
giving clarification about minor project details.
Presentations are a bit more formal —
even if they're in the form of an email.
Whether your stakeholders will receive
your project updates in their inboxes,
on a phone call,
at a meeting, or a mixture of these
is something you should confirm early, when
verifying project scope and deadlines.
And no matter which format you're using,
always follow presentation and
communication best practices.
This includes engaging your audience by
taking the time to understand their point of view.
Think about their stake in the project and what they hope
to gain from the data insights that you deliver.
Next, be sure to
prioritize the most relevant information.
This means starting with high-level updates first,
whether that's something about your current progress,
a recent change, or your plans for next steps.
Use clear, concise, and accessible language.
An effective BI professional recognizes
that some people will have used a dashboard before,
but that's not often the case.
Even though BI is a technical realm,
it's wise to avoid using too much technical jargon.
Explain your work as simply as possible —
this is another example of
the importance of empathizing with your audience.
I find that it's important to tailor the words and
level of detail for each particular audience.
For example, I know
executives with technical backgrounds who are going to
want me to get deep into
the details, while others just want the bottom-line.
Lastly, if a stakeholder shared
a concern with you in the previous meeting,
it's important that your next presentation
describes how you addressed
that issue. And be sure to confirm
that they're satisfied with your plan going forward.
The first time you present to your stakeholders will
likely be when sharing your low-fidelity mockups.
As you've learned, these sketches
give everyone a clear idea of
your design intentions and they're
essential to getting necessary feedback.
Typically, you'll have an initial call or email when
you ask if the idea you're
presenting meet stakeholder goals.
And because the mockup stages early on in the design process,
you can take in people's ideas and suggestions.
Then, if necessary,
easily move in a new direction before you
invest hours in bringing your mockup
to life on an actual dashboard.
Later, you'll share
your functional dashboard with your users.
First and foremost, this
involves explaining how to use it.
Even the clearest and most intuitive dashboards
deserve explanation.
Here, you might provide
a live demonstration or you could create
a slide deck about how to interpret
the visuals and change the settings.
Lastly, you are now aware that
the majority of dashboards are constantly evolving tools,
so they don't necessarily have a "final state."
Just keep presenting updates on
recent changes or new opportunities
that have been identified.
Then, you'll be able to successfully collaborate with
stakeholders and keep your dashboards
as fresh and helpful as possible. 


## Business intelligence presentation examples

In this part of the certificate program, you started thinking about how to present your insights to stakeholders. Slide decks are a common tool that you can use to present to your stakeholders and even showcase and explain your dashboards. This reading will provide you with some tips and tricks for designing slide presentations. For more resources, you can also check out the Google Data Analytics Certificate content about developing presentations and slideshows. 

### Tips for building a presentation

Use the following tips and sample layout to build your own presentation.

- Tip 1: Always remember audience and purpose

To develop an effective presentation that communicates your point, it’s important to keep your audience in mind. Ask yourself these two questions to help you define the overall flow and build out your presentation:

1. Who is my audience?

    If your intended audience is primarily high-level executives, your presentation should be kept at a high level. Executives tend to focus on main takeaways that encourage improving, correcting, or inventing things. Keep your presentation brief and spend most of your time on results and recommendations, or provide a walkthrough of how they can best use the tools you’ve created. It can be useful to create an executive summary slide that synthesizes the whole presentation in one slide.

    If your intended audience is comprised of stakeholders and managers, they might have more time to learn about new processes, how you developed the right tools, and ask more technical questions. Be prepared to provide more details with this audience!

    If your intended audience is comprised of analysts and individual contributors, you will have the most freedom—and perhaps the most time—to go in to more detail about the data, processes, and results.

    Support all members of your audience by making your content accessible for audience members with diverse abilities, experiences, and backgrounds.

2. What is the purpose of my presentation?

    If the goal of your presentation is to request or recommend something at the end, like a sales pitch, you can have each slide work toward the recommendations at the end.

    If the goal of your presentation is to focus on the results of your analysis, each slide can help mark the path to the results. Be sure to include plenty of views of the data analysis steps to demonstrate the path you took with the data.

    If the goal of your presentation is to provide a report on the data analysis, your slides should clearly summarize your data and key findings. In this case, it is alright to simply offer the data on its own.

    If the goal of your presentation is to showcase how to use new business intelligence tools, your slides should clearly showcase what your audience needs to understand to start using the tool themselves.

- Tip 2: Prepare talking points and limit text on slides

As you create each slide in your presentation, prepare talking points (also called speaker notes) on what you will say.

Don’t forget that you will be talking at the same time that your audience is reading your slides. If your slides start becoming more like documents, you should rethink what you will say so that you can remove some text from the slides. Make it easy for your audience to skim read the slides while still paying attention to what you are saying. In general, follow the five-second rule. Your audience should not be spending more than five seconds reading any block of text on a slide.

Knowing exactly what you will say throughout your presentation creates a natural flow to your story, and helps avoid awkward pauses between topics. Slides that summarize data can also be repetitive; if you prepare a variety of interesting talking points about the data, you can keep your audience alert and paying attention.

- Tip 3: End with your recommendations

Ending your presentation with recommendations and key takeaways brings the presentation to a natural close, reminds your audience of the key points, and allows them to leave with a strong impression of your recommendations. Use one slide for your recommendations at the end, and make them clear and concise. And, if you are recommending that something be done, provide next steps and describe what you would consider a successful outcome.

- Tip 4: Allow enough time for the presentation and questions

Assume that everyone in your audience is busy. Keep your presentation on topic and as short as possible by:

Being aware of your timing. This applies to the total number of slides and the time you spend on each slide. A good starting point is to spend 1-2 minutes on summary slides and 3-5 minutes on slides that generate discussion.  

Presenting your data efficiently. Make sure that every slide tells a unique and important part of your data story. If a slide isn’t that unique, you might think about combining the information on that slide with another slide.

Saving enough time for questions at the end or allowing enough time to answer questions throughout your presentation.

### Putting it all together: Your slide deck layout

This section will cover how to put everything together in a sample slide deck layout. This is just one way you can format your slide presentations–you may find that other layouts work better for you and your presentation style. That’s great! But this is a clear and concise starting point you can use to develop clear and effective slide decks. 

1. First slide: Agenda 

Provide a high-level bulleted list of the topics you will cover and the amount of time you will spend on each. Every company’s practices are different, but in general, most presentations run from 30 minutes to an hour at most. Here is an example of a 30-minute agenda:

    Introductions (4 minutes)
    Project overview and goals (5 minutes)
    Data and analysis (10 minutes)
    Recommendations (3 minutes)
    Actionable steps (3 minutes)
    Questions (5 minutes)

2. Second slide: Purpose

Not everyone in your audience is familiar with your project or knows why it is important. They didn’t spend the last couple of weeks thinking through the BI processes and tools for your project like you did. This slide summarizes the purpose of the project for your audience and why it is important to the business.

Here is an example of a purpose statement: Service center consolidation is an important cost savings initiative. The aim of this project is to monitor the impact of service center consolidation on customer response times for continued improvement. 

3. Third slide: Data/analysis

When discussing the data, the BI processes and tools, and how your audience can use them, be sure to include the following:

    Slides typically have a logical order (beginning, middle, and end) to fully build the story. 

    Each slide should logically introduce the slide that follows it.
    Visual cues from the slides or verbal cues from your talking points should let the audience know when you will go on to the next slide. 

    Remember not to use too much text on the slides. When in doubt, refer back to the second tip on preparing talking points and limiting the text on slides. 

    The high-level information that people read from the slides shouldn’t be the same as the information you provide in your talking points. 
    There should be a nice balance between the two to tell a good story. You don’t want to simply read or say the words on the slides.

For extra visuals on the slides, use animations. For example, you can:

    Fade in one bullet point at a time as you discuss each on a slide.

    Only display the visual that is relevant to what you are talking about (fade out non-relevant visuals).

    Use arrows or callouts to point to a specific area of a visual that you are using.

4. Fourth slide: Recommendations

If you have been telling your story well in the previous slides, the recommendations will be obvious to your audience. This is when you might get a lot of questions about how your data supports your recommendations. Be ready to communicate how your data backs up your conclusion or recommendations in different ways. Having multiple words to state the same thing also helps if someone is having difficulty with one particular explanation.

5. Fifth slide: Call to action

Sometimes the call to action can be combined with the recommendations slide. If there are multiple actions or activities recommended, a separate slide is best. 

Recall our example of a purpose statement: Service center consolidation is an important cost savings initiative. The aim of this project is to monitor the impact of service center consolidation on customer response times for continued improvement. 

Suppose the monitoring reports showed that service center consolidation negatively impacted customer response times. A call to action might be to examine if processes need to change to bring customer response times back to what they were before the consolidation.

- Wrapping it up: Getting feedback 

After you present to your audience, think about how you told your data story and how you can get feedback for improvement. Consider asking your manager or a colleague for candid thoughts about your storytelling and presentation overall. Feedback is great to help you improve. Just like most of the work you’ll do as a BI professional, presentations are an iterative process! 


## Case study: Ipsos - Informing stakeholders with compelling data visualizations

In this course, you’ve learned a lot about business intelligence visualizations and what makes an effective BI presentation. In this case study, you’ll learn about how Ipsos, a market research company, planned and executed a BI presentation. 

Ipsos worked with stakeholders to complete a brand-tracking project that involved advertisements and marketing. When the marketing team completed their dashboard, they presented their tracking tool and insights to their stakeholders.

- Company background

Ipsos is a globally-operating market research and polling company. The company builds solutions that provide insights into the actions, opinions, and motivations of citizens, consumers, patients, customers, and employees. Its solutions are based on data from surveys, social media monitoring, and qualitative or observational techniques.

- The project details

The primary goal of the marketing team’s presentation was to communicate their insights to their stakeholders.

To agree on project details, the Ipsos account team met with the client team. They agreed on a list of priorities for charts and visualizations, the content of the dashboard, and the basic aesthetic and usability elements.

The Ipsos team used Looker as its dashboard platform, since it would be compatible with client’s existing Google Cloud infrastructure. This meant that Ipsos could avoid additional development on the data structure and create a dashboard that the client team would be most familiar with.

Ipsos built an advertisement dashboard that tracked the number of visitors and impressions that the client’s ads received. It also measured how long people watched the ads, how many purchases resulted from the ad, how much profit the ads incurred, and more.
A Looker dashboard with main KPIs, bar charts, a line graph, and a table representing ad outreach metrics.

- The presentation approach

When preparing for the presentation, Ipsos decided to take a more conversational and interactive approach. They felt the dashboard should be experienced by its potential users as soon as possible. To do this, Ipsos made an effort to authorize and authenticate the stakeholder team’s users in advance. By the time Ipsos began their presentation, the client team could use and interact with the dashboard in real time.

In the initial meeting, the Ipsos team described the output of the dashboard and demonstrated how the user interface worked. Ipsos focused the meeting on reporting functionality and saved the more technical content for follow-up meetings. 

In these meetings, Ipsos invited other members of the client team and focused on other content. This content included the scripting, coding, and other technical aspects that wouldn’t be appropriate for the core team.

In each meeting, Ipsos used their two-part plan of providing a demonstration first and then allowing the users to experience the platform themselves. It was helpful for everyone to watch the Ipsos expert describe and interact with the user interface before the interactive session.

- The feedback

At the end of the presentation, the client’s representatives shared positive comments about Ipsos’ work. They also mentioned a few aspects of the dashboard that they wanted to optimize.

After the presentation, the stakeholders organized their feedback in writing and delivered it to the Ipsos team. The feedback addressed two areas: the potential limitations of the platform for user data ingestion and the opportunities to further refine and develop the dashboard.

With this feedback, Ipsos could iterate on the dashboard tool and continue collaborating with their client.

- Lessons learned

Key lessons learned and actions Ipsos would repeat include:

    Establishing appropriate expectations and communicating frequently

    Including their audience in the creation of presentation content

    Encouraging participation during the presentation and identifying ways to involve the audience

    Demonstrating the dashboard during the presentation and allowing the audience to make data requests to the presenter

    Highlighting essential content and user benefits in the initial presentation, then focusing on highly technical content in subsequent meetings

For future presentations, Ipsos would adjust some trade offs they made about accessibility and complex data layouts. They learned they could generate simpler functionality at first, then later build out more complex designs that require advanced development later in the dashboard building process. This way, they could reduce the amount of iteration they have to do on their visualizations.

- Conclusion

A more casual and interactive approach to the presentation encouraged user learning and clarified feedback for the Ipsos team. Three parts in this process were helpful:

    Communicating and pre-planning with the client team about expectations and desired outcomes for the presentation

    Choosing to demonstrate the platform and its functionality live

    Pre-authorizing and authenticating users so that they could get on-platform and start exploring the tool as soon as possible

These choices led to faster adoption of the tool and allowed the feedback process to clearly and concisely focus on desired changes.

In your future presentations, you’ll find the most effective strategies to streamline tool adoption and expedite feedback. The more effort you put into your presentation, the easier it will be to collaborate with your stakeholders.


## Activity: Design a slide deck for a business intelligence presentation 

- Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a slide deck for a business intelligence project presentation. BI presentations can take many forms, but generally you will be expected to make slide decks to share your work with supervisors or stakeholders.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

- Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Choose a BI project to present in your slide deck. You can use a project you created during this course or find a dataset on your own to create a new project.

If you want to use a project from this course, you can use the dashboard about Minnesota’s traffic volume that you made in previous activities. You can also use the dashboard you created in a previous section to represent housing data in Athens, Greece. 

If you want to find your own dataset to create a new BI project, go to Kaggle or public datasets on BigQuery. 

Now it’s time to create a slide deck presentation. BI presentations take many forms, but the “final” presentation to a supervisor or stakeholder is usually a slide deck. This presentation should include an intro slide, a summary of the business questions you answered, your methods for creating your project, and a few key insights about the data.

- Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

1. Part 1 - Prepare for your presentation

Once you’ve selected the dashboard you’d like to present with a slide deck, it’s time to collect image samples. In your slide deck, you’ll share visual examples of what your dashboard looks like. This might be to share insights or to demonstrate why you organized your dashboard in a specific way. 

You can take screenshots in a variety of ways, but one helpful and simple way to do it in Tableau Public is to download an image file of your visualization. To do this, go to the editing interface or the published view of your dashboard. Then click Download and select the Image option to download a .jpg file of your visualization.

Next, decide where to create your slide deck presentation. If you have a Google account, you can use Google Slides. You are also welcome to use another presentation application, as long as it allows you to present your slides in a conference room or over a video call.

2. Part 2 - Create your presentation

The first slide you’ll include in your presentation is an intro slide. You’ll want to include a brief title for the project and your name and/or your company’s.

Your intro slide should be very simple and include only the bare minimum information for your audience to understand your project’s topic. You can include aesthetic elements, such as borders, graphics, and colors, as long as they match the visuals or subject matter of the rest of your presentation.

In at least one slide, describe or summarize the business problem that your BI visualization addresses. Your slides should feature only a few bullet points or visuals, and should not be too wordy. 

In at least one slide, describe how you processed and/or visualized the data. You can describe how you built your pipeline, which metrics you focused on, the types of charts you chose, and any other notable steps involved in your BI project process. 

In at least one slide, summarize some insights from your visualization. This might include general trends, significant differences from project expectations, or recommendations about what your client’s project should do in the future. 

You should include 1–3 high-level insights or trends. Ideally, the insights are direct answers to the business questions you answered. If your stakeholder wants to know the busiest holiday for traffic, then you can share the chart that includes that answer.

Depending on the needs of your presentation, you might also want to include additional information. You might talk about your background, your experience with the project, or what you would have done differently if you had more time or data.

In a professional setting, your team or supervisor will tell you if there is any additional information you should include. Otherwise, use your best judgment when deciding what info to include. Slide deck presentations should be simple and concise above all else. But, if there are any essential details that your presentation needs, include them now.

- What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed slide deck: 

    An engaging intro slide
    A brief description of the business problem your project answers
    A brief description of the methods you used to create your visualization
    A brief summary of insights from your visualization or recommendations for the client’s future 


### Assessment of Exemplar

This exemplar presentation is a brief slide deck that presents the Minnesota Interstate Traffic Dataset that you used in a previous activity. Your slide deck might appear very different from the exemplar if you used a different dataset or project. If so, ensure that your presentation still includes the following four categories of slides.

- Introduction slide

Your first slide should include the following components:

    A title
    A visual element
    Optional: a subtitle
    Optional: Your name or company

In this exemplar, Slide 1 has the title “Minnesota Interstate Traffic Volume,” the subtitle “An in-depth analysis of traffic patterns on our interstate highways,” the Minnesota Department of Transportation logo, and a graphic of a car. It includes a simple color palette but few other details that distract from the introductory slide.

- Business problem

In this exemplar, Slide 2 includes a very brief description of the business problem. The slide includes a picture of the Minnesota interstate with high traffic congestion. Some projects you work on might require more slides devoted to describing the business problem, but this simple slide is enough of a summary in this case.

- Methods

Slide 3 of the exemplar describes the three primary charts used to visualize the data: Monthly Volumes, Weather, and Holiday Travel. It also includes a short description for each chart that suggests reasoning for separating the data into its own chart.

- Insights

Slides 4–6 summarize the most important insights from the dashboard. Each slide features a chart that was introduced in Slide 3. These slides include images of each of the charts.

Slide 4 explains that August generally has the highest traffic volume, and February has the lowest. It points out an unusual dip in traffic in April 2018 and that aside from this dip the traffic trends are consistent from year to year.

Slide 5 focuses on weather and its effects on traffic. It also introduces a question: : What can the Minnesota Department of Transportation do to alleviate traffic issues on rainy days?

Slide 6 explains the holiday traffic trends. It supposes that the high traffic in August might be partially due to the state fair that takes place during that month. It also suggests that the holidays in January contribute to most of the traffic volume during that month.

Slide 7 examines when hourly traffic patterns emerge and if holidays impact them. It also explains that while to- and from-work commuter traffic has higher volume, there is not a significant difference during a holiday.

Slide 8 is the final slide and includes a quick signoff to conclude the slide deck presentation. This slide also helps the presenter transition into asking the audience if they have any questions.

- Key takeaways

BI presentations can take many forms. A slide deck is a convenient and simple medium for sharing your insights with your stakeholders. You can customize a slide deck an infinite number of ways, while still communicating the most important information. The presentation you made in this activity will help you prepare for many slide decks you’ll make in your role as a BI professional.



# CAREER FOCUS: PROJECTS & PORTFOLIOS

## The business intelligence professional hiring process

Hi!
It's great to be back with you
to continue learning about the BI profession.
So far in this section,
you've learned how to share your work and insights
with your stakeholders during a project.
Now, you'll apply those same presentation skills
to your career advancement.
If you haven't met me yet, I'm Anita,
a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst at Google.
The job search can sometimes feel
difficult and time-consuming.
I encourage all of my candidates to stay positive
if they don't get the first role they interview for.
It's not uncommon for a person
to interview for many different roles
before they finally find the right match.
Understanding how the BI industry works
will help you navigate your job search.
The first thing to know is that BI is everywhere.
In every industry, companies need business intelligence
to make informed decisions.
Whether you have a passion for healthcare, finance,
human resources, retail, education,
construction, or anything else... there's a BI job for you.
You can begin searching for a BI job
by narrowing your criteria to a specific industry.
Your query could be "business intelligence healthcare"
or "business intelligence finance."
If you don't have a preference,
you can search more generally by trying
"entry-level business intelligence."
The second thing to know is that
there are a few specific titles
that a BI professional can have.
Typically, an entry-level or early-career BI professional
will be called a "Business Intelligence Analyst."
You may also encounter
"Junior" or "Assistant Business Intelligence Analyst."
Job offers with this title may expect
anywhere from zero to three years of experience.
However, if a BI job asks for
more years of experience than you have,
you should apply anyway.
As long as your skillset matches the job description,
it's worth applying.
With a strong portfolio and resume,
you may be a great candidate
even if you don't have a lot of experience.
If you're looking for a job in a specific industry,
the job listing may ask for
skills or knowledge related to that field.
You can research job opportunities
in your industry of interest
to find which additional skills you should develop.
Where exactly should you apply to BI jobs?
You can find listings on any job searching site,
such as LinkedIn, Indeed, or Glassdoor.
And a quick Google search can help you find
some more recent job opportunities.
Through these sites or the companys' specific forms,
you'll be able to fill out job applications
and share your resume and portfolio.
Otherwise, you can email
the position's hiring manager to apply.
If you do get a response to your application,
you'll likely interact with a recruiter or hiring manager.
They may reach out to you with an email or a phone call
to schedule an interview.
If so, congratulations!
You can prepare by researching the company,
if you haven't already, and rehearsing for your interview.
Some organizations may contact you
for multiple rounds of interviews,
especially if they've received a lot of applications.
You may be asked to describe the projects in your portfolio
or complete a short BI-related exercise,
kind of like the activities
you've been doing in this program.
Once you complete your final interview, the waiting begins.
Arguably, this is the hardest part,
but you can make the most of this time.
First, you should follow up by thanking the interviewer.
You can also apply to more jobs
and work on refining your BI skills.
Hopefully, you'll soon have an exciting, new opportunity.
Now that you know what to expect from the BI hiring process,
it's time to prepare your application materials.
This includes your BI projects,
portfolio, and an updated resume.
Then, you'll learn more about interview techniques
to help you get hired for your first BI position. 


## Use prediction for better collaboration

In this program, you have been learning all about the role business intelligence professionals fill in an organization, how they build systems to store and move data where it needs to go, and how they create visualization and dashboard tools to share insights. You’ve also been learning about how monitoring can be used to provide stakeholders with updated information to inform decisions. Monitoring can also be used for predictive analytics. Normally this is not part of a BI professional’s role, but the tools they create can be used by data scientists to make predictions. In this reading, you’ll be introduced to predictive analytics and how BI professionals are sometimes involved. 

- Predictive analytics

Predictive analytics is a branch of data analytics that uses historical data to identify patterns to forecast future outcomes that can guide decision-making. The goal of predictive analytics is to anticipate upcoming events and preemptively make decisions according to those predictions. The predictions can focus on any point in the future—from weekly measurements to revenue predictions for the next year. 

By feeding historical data into a predictive model, stakeholders can make decisions that aren’t just based on what has already happened in the past—they can make decisions that take into account likely future events, too! 

One example would be a hotel using predictive analytics to determine staffing needs for major holidays. In the hospitality industry, there are many variables that might affect staffing decisions: the number of guests, what services they’re using the most or how much it costs to pay employees to be there.

Being able to predict needs and schedule employees appropriately is key. So, a hotel might use a predictive model to consider all of these factors to inform staffing decisions. 

Another example could be a marketing team using predictive analysis to time their advertising campaigns. Based on the successes of previous years, the marketing team can assess what trends are likely to follow in the coming year and plan accordingly.

- Presenting dashboards

As a BI professional, you might not be performing predictive analytics as part of your role. However, the tools you build to monitor or update data might be helpful for data scientists on your team who will perform this kind of analysis. By presenting dashboards effectively, you can properly communicate to stakeholders or data scientists what the next step will be in the data pipeline, and set them up to take the tools you create to the next level. 

- Key takeaways

BI professionals collaborate with a variety of different teams and experts to support the business needs of their organization. Predictive analytics likely will not be a task you perform on the job, but you may work with teams who do. Understanding the basics will help you consider their needs as you design tools to support all of the teams who rely on your work!


## Heather: Personal career journey into BI

Hi, my name is Heather and I am
a data and analytics sales specialist.
I was a waitress in New York City for many years.
I do not have a bachelor's degree and
my grandfather was able to
work his way up in business,
and as a child, he told me I could do the same,
so I did that.
I always thought that
finding my voice in an organization,
starting small and working my way up,
that industry for me just happened to be
the technology industry where I fell.
I took internships for free
and then I'd waitress at night.
I would search on LinkedIn,
I would friend people on LinkedIn,
and ask them to have a conversation with me,
and introduce myself to them and say,
"Hi, I'm Heather. These are the things I'm good at,
I'm good with people,
I'm good with numbers,
I know how to use computer systems,
I can be an asset on your team."
I probably did that over and over again for
about three years until I landed my first job in tech.
I think being a server or being
a waitress or a bar attender and anybody in any kind
of restaurant industry has
really wonderful transferable skills
to land a job in business intelligence.
I have a lot of clients.
I work with a lot of partners,
and I also work with a lot of team members.
The skills that I
learned working in the service industry,
especially in New York City,
is being able to multitask,
have a lot of tables at once,
being able to remember your orders,
being really kind to your regulars.
My customers, I view them as my regulars
just as I did when I bar tended ten years ago,
making sure that they're happy.
How many times do you go to
a restaurant and something isn't right
and if the server gives you a tough experience,
well, you're going to remember that.
Now working in business intelligence,
I have a solutions architect that I work with,
I have a customer engineer I work with,
and other partners to help me rally around a customer.
When I solve a problem for a customer and they're
efficiently utilizing our data and analytics platforms,
it brings me a lot of joy because I know
that I'm helping them grow their business.
I had maybe six or seven hours worth of video calls
and I was really on a roll
with each one and I was understanding their problems,
I was able to talk about our products in a technical,
effective way, and it made me feel so happy
when I was able to communicate
that way with my customers,
with my extended team.
Just don't be hard on yourself and
don't be scared to ask people questions.
Don't be scared to connect with people on
LinkedIn and ask for a conversation
to introduce yourself.
People don't do that anymore,
so set yourself apart and put yourself out there. 


## Incorporate business intelligence work in your portfolio

If you've earned
your Google Data Analytics Certificate
or completed any non-BI data projects,
you may already have a portfolio.
As a reminder, a portfolio
is a collection of materials
that can be shared with potential employers.
It's the part of your job application
with evidence of your accomplishments.
If you don't have a portfolio yet,
it's time to make one.
This is a shareable,
accessible way to showcase your work,
which can give you an advantage
over other candidates.
Also, a well-rounded portfolio demonstrates
your background in non-data industries,
and the transferable skills you've gained.
Portfolios enable you
to share project planning documents,
dashboards, presentations,
and any other assets that will help
demonstrate your skills.
You can host your portfolio
on your own custom website
or use an existing data sharing platform.
Sites such as GitHub or Kaggle
that you may have used for sharing data
can be used to link out to dashboards.
Tableau also has a social platform
and sharing capabilities.
Once you pick a platform,
or multiple platforms,
to host your portfolio,
you can add your projects.
Choose whether to represent your projects
by including your data,
screenshots of your dashboard,
the embedded dashboard itself,
or all of the above.
Or you can include a link
to access your dashboard on Tableau.
When you've included all the relevant parts
from your project in your portfolio,
explain your process.
Describe your thought process,
what work you did,
and what you might do differently in the future.
It also helps to include a short biography.
By describing your professional goals and interests,
you can personalize your portfolio
and make it stand out.
Now, there's one very important thing to keep in mind:
Some projects you work on may deal with private data,
so it's critical to make sure
that you follow your employers' rules
and regulations for data sharing.
In cases where you cannot share any data
or visuals from your project,
you can include a summary of what
you did in your portfolio.
Which details you can share
may be up to your employer,
but it's still important to document
the roles you had on each project you were part of.
Now, it's time to create or update your portfolio.
This will be a process
you go through periodically throughout your career. 



# CAREER FOCUS: JOIN THE FIELD OF BI

## Refine your resume

Recruiters go through tons of applications
during the hiring process.
So having a compelling resume is super important
to becoming a candidate of choice.
If you earned your Google Data Analytics Certificate,
you learned a lot about creating an effective resume.
Now we're going to refine your original resume
to be appropriate for the BI world.
Feel free to take a minute to review those lessons now
so you're ready to proceed.
Updating your resume will enable you
to emphasize your BI skills.
This is a good practice whenever you apply
for new types of jobs.
The first thing to do is update the education section.
Include any degrees and certificates you've earned,
as well as vocational training.
Right now, you're almost done with this program.
When you earn your certificate,
you'll be able to include it in your resume too.
For now, you can indicate that you're currently working
toward your Google Business Intelligence Certificate.
Then, update the skills section
with any new data know-how you've gained.
This can include everything you've learned
during this course and anything else
that's relevant to the workplace.
Make sure to use specific language to describe your skills.
For example, "data management" is not specific
because there are many ways to manage data.
Instead, you could include "data cleaning"
and "data merging" as types of data management.
The same applies for BI-specific skills.
Rather than using "business intelligence,"
you can list "data modeling" and "dashboard building."
In your skills section or a separate tool section,
include the software you're most familiar with.
Because you used BigQuery and Tableau in this program,
you can put them on your resume.
If you learn other kinds of BI software
after completing this program,
make sure to include them as well.
Now it's time for some general resume tips
that apply to any industry.
If you've created resumes before,
you may already know and do some of these things.
Still, hopefully the following tips can serve
as a helpful reminder.
It's always good practice to create multiple versions
of your resume.
Each time you apply to a job, you can tweak the language
to best match the job description.
For instance, if you're applying
to a BI job in the retail sector
you can emphasize any past retail experience you might have.
Then, if you apply to a job in a different field,
you can remove those details to make room
for other accomplishments.
These tweaks can help highlight specific skills
that set you apart from other candidates.
Another tip is to list the most recent
and relevant information at the top
of the education, skills, and job experience sections.
Recruiters and hiring managers are very busy
and may spend only a short amount of time on each resume.
It always helps to be brief and direct to highlight
the most important content as quickly as possible.
Now that you know some BI resume tips,
it's time to make these updates a reality.
A strong resume is essential
to catching the attention of recruiters and hiring managers.
With your completed portfolio and resume,
you'll be ready to move on to the final component
of the application process: interviews. 


## Resume-writing workshop

A key tool for your job search as a business intelligence professional is your resume. At this point, you may already have a resume that you have been using. Or, if you completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate lesson about resume-building, you have a foundation for creating your BI-specific resume. In this reading, you will learn more about refining your resume for BI roles. This will help you as you continue revising your resume for your future job searches!

- Highlight your best qualities

When creating or revising your resume, you will need to consider what you want to highlight about yourself to potential employers.

For instance, if you have relevant work experience, then you will want to pick a format that highlights that.

If you are transitioning from a different career and don’t yet have relevant work experience, then you may want to pick a format that highlights your technical skills and portfolio projects. Some resume formats include a “Summary” or “Goals” section at the top to help candidates add context to their application, while other resume formats avoid these sections completely and uses that space for sections such as “Skills” and “Experience”.

Whatever format you pick, your resume should ideally be one page. If the one-page rule seems limiting, think about the purpose resumes serve in the hiring process overall. Resumes are short documents designed to communicate the most important information about yourself to recruiters and hiring managers at a glance. This is also why it’s important to consider what you want to highlight most—this is one of the first impressions you make on potential employers!

- Writing about your experience

As you think about how to represent your work experience on your resume effectively, it might be helpful to refer to these best practices:

1. Focus on your accomplishments first, and explain them using the formula Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.

    These statements help you communicate the most important things a recruiter or hiring manager is searching for—the impact of your work.

    Whenever possible, use numbers to explain your accomplishments. For example, “Increased manufacturing productivity by 15% by improving shop floor employee engagement,” is better than “Increased manufacturing productivity.”

2. Phrase your work experience and duties using Problem-Action-Result (PAR) statements.

    For example, instead of saying “was responsible for two blogs a month,” phrase it as “earned little-known website over 2,000 new clicks through strategic blogging.”

3. Describe jobs that highlight transferable skills (those skills that can transfer from one job or industry to another).

    This is especially important if you are transitioning from another industry into business intelligence.

    For example, communication is a skill often used in job descriptions for business intelligence professionals, so highlight examples from your work experience that demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively.

4. Describe jobs that highlight your soft skills.

    These are non-technical traits and behaviors that relate to how you work. Are you detail-oriented? Do you have grit and perseverance? Are you a strong critical thinker? Do you have leadership skills?

    For instance, you could give an example of when you demonstrated leadership on the job. Showing is always more effective than telling.

This is almost always the hardest part of crafting a resume, especially if you are transitioning from a different career field. However, if you take a moment to think deeply about your previous work experience, you’ll likely discover that you can find ways to represent your work experiences in a way that highlights your ability to do things important to business intelligence roles, such as thinking critically or making data-driven decisions.

- Putting your skills to the test

Many companies use algorithms to screen and filter resumes for keywords. If your resume does not contain the keywords they are searching for, a human may never even read your resume. Reserving at least one bullet point to list specific programs you are familiar with or skills you have is a great way to make sure your resume makes it past automated keyword screenings and onto the desk of a recruiter or hiring manager. The following are some best practices for adding skills to your resume effectively.

- Get help from the real world

Reviewing real-world resumes is always a great idea. It can help you get a feel for how others in the industry are representing their experience and skills. You can find resumes on job sites, LinkedIn, or even just by searching for “business intelligence resume.” There are many ways to represent your technical skills, and taking a moment to understand how other professionals do this may give you some great ideas.

- What skills to add

The skills section on your resume likely only has room for 2-4 bullet points, so be sure to use this space effectively. You might want to avoid listing soft skills or non-technical skills here. Instead, this is a great chance for you to highlight some of the skills you’ve picked up in these courses, such as:

    Strong analytical skills
    Pattern recognition
    Relational databases and SQL
    Strong data visualization skills
    Proficiency with spreadsheets, SQL, DataFlow, and Tableau

Notice how the skills listed above communicate a well-rounded skill set without using more words than necessary. The skills section summarizes what you’re capable of doing while listing the technology and tools you are proficient in.

- Fine-tuning your resume

One of the most important ways you can adapt your existing resume is by making it specifically tailored to BI roles. Below are links to two resume examples. The first example is a rough draft an entry-level BI professional created early on in her resume writing process. The second resume is her final draft. This version is more specific about the roles she is interested in and how her previous experience can be applied to BI roles. Refer to both versions below: Resume drafts.

Like a lot of the skills you have been learning in this program, resume writing is an iterative process. This BI professional took their original resume and revised it to be more specific and detailed in order to explain how she was a great fit for the BI roles she was applying to. Similarly, you can continue to revise and fine-tune your resume to meet your needs throughout your job search.


## Kelly: Tips for resume preparation

I'm Kelly. I'm a sustainability financial analyst here at Google, and basically,
what that means, is that I work with the global sustainability team here.
And I partner with them for any of their external commitments, and
any of the work that they do.
So when I first started figuring out what I wanted to do and when I first
started trying to get internships and get my foot in door at these big companies,
it was really hard for me to understand what I needed to do,
how to find mentors, what resources were available to even get my foot in the door.
And so, I found an opportunity and I wanted to create that opportunity for
others, and that's why I created my TikTok channel.
I wanted to make sure that all of those things that I really struggled
with to find, other people could find them more easily,
and also just show people that, if I could do it, they could do it too.
So, how I actually tailor my resume to different experiences and make sure
that my relevant experience is shown for specific roles that I'm applying to,
is creating a document listing out all of the experiences that you've had,
using the star method.
So for each role, list out the situation, the task, the action, and the results, and
have that readily available for all the jobs or experiences that you've had.
And then you can actually take the job posting, whichever one that you're seeing,
whichever job you would like to apply to,
and take the relevant experience that you have, and
map it directly to the job posting. So, for example, if the job requires data and
analytics, or the job requires working with stakeholders,
and you have that in your relevant experience,
make sure to put that at the top of your resume.
Whatever job posting you're looking at, if they have keywords for skills required,
make sure that you have those words listed on your resume as well.
You might have really great analytical experience,
But if you're leaving out those keywords that recruiters are looking for,
you might get missed.
Second of all, when actually looking at your resume, make sure to be succinct, and
precise with the bullet points that you're listing, as well as the experience.
A lot of the times people will want to write out paragraphs on their experiences,
and what they did.
But the more clear and precise that you can make it, the easier it's going to be
for a recruiter to actually read through your resume.
And lastly, make sure that your listing only relevant experiences,
if there are things that you've had on your resume for
couple of years that might not be very relevant to the job posting.
Make sure to take those out so
that the things that are relevant can shine on your resume as well.
If I could give one piece of advice to someone who wants
to get into business intelligence, it's just apply.
Don't be afraid to take that first step, and get your foot in the door, because,
the rest will follow.
And, some of my favorite advice that I've ever gotten was, it's going to be
better than you even imagined, so just let yourself get to that place.


## Interview preparation strategies

If you've experienced a job interview before,
you probably know what to expect.
You might feel some nerves as you prepare for it,
excitement as you discuss your passions and accomplishments,
and anticipation as you wait for a job offer.
But what should you know about BI job interviews?
What might give you an advantage
in a competitive job market?
The most important topic to discuss is your data experience.
This includes your non-BI data background,
and, of course, your hard work during this course.
Projects that you complete
in a learning environment are extremely valuable,
even if you don't have an official role yet.
After all, BI professionals learn on the job every day.
It's half the fun.
Then, you want to demonstrate your BI knowledge.
You can do this by explaining your step-by-step process,
like you did while creating your portfolio write-ups.
Here, you can get into specifics.
Explain your project planning process,
your approach to data modeling,
and your dashboard design strategies.
Discuss any obstacles you encountered
and how you overcame them.
Did you ask for help, try a new approach,
or research solutions?
Explaining how you dealt with a problem
in your project will highlight your resilience,
positive attitude, and creativity.
You also want to list your skills.
It might be tempting to talk mostly about your people skills
or how you're a very hard worker.
While this is true,
interviews also wanna know about technical skills.
Describe the coding languages
and tools you're familiar with.
Make sure to discuss the technical skills you developed
in this course, such as Python and Tableau.
For instance, on our Finance and Data Analytics team,
we sometimes search for a candidate
who knows a particular coding language.
Other times, it's important for us to hire someone
who can pick up multiple new languages quickly.
Some hiring managers may even ask you
to complete a coding exercise
to demonstrate your skill level.
If so, make sure you understand
which skills they will assess
so you can prepare accordingly.
I always tell candidates,
"Don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions
if you don't have all the information you need."
No recruiter expects you to know everything.
And, finally, talk about how excited you are
to start in a BI role.
Interviewers want to hire someone
who is both competent and enthusiastic.
The hiring manager may guide most of your interview.
They may steer the conversations with their questions,
but you should make sure to discuss each of these topics
before your interview is over.
In general, it also helps
to remember some universal interview best practices.
Answer the interviewer's questions descriptively
and prioritize the most relevant information.
Speak with a friendly but professional tone.
Whether you're in an in-person or virtual setting,
dress appropriately, make eye contact,
and keep your body language as relaxed and natural
as you can.
That last one might be tough if you're nervous,
but that's okay.
Interviewers understand that you are eager
to make a good impression.
It will also help to think of questions you may want
to ask the interviewer.
You'll want to know what kinds of data you will work on,
how many people are on the company's BI team,
and what you would be expected to do in the role.
You can also ask about the organization's commitment
to inclusivity or their philosophy on work-life balance.
By asking your own questions, you demonstrate your interest
and that you're a proactive learner.
After all, asking the right questions
is a BI professional's first job.
Each interview is a new opportunity
to show off how hard you've worked
and get one step closer to an amazing new job. 


## Proactive approaches to the interview process

Throughout your career as a business intelligence professional, you will interview with potential employers during the application process. Interviewing is a key skill for your job search. In this reading, you’ll consider how to identify BI-specific roles during your job search as well as general tips for interviewing.

### Identify BI roles

Part of your job search will include identifying roles that are specific to the BI field. As you learned in previous lessons, there are many types of data-related jobs, but there are key elements you can search for in job descriptions to determine if a job is actually a BI role.

1. Search for keywords: An easy way to identify BI-specific roles is to search for job listings that refer to business intelligence directly. Often, BI-related roles will be listed as “business intelligence analyst” or “business intelligence engineer.” Previously, you learned about the differences between BI analysts and engineers, but these terms are often used interchangeably; be sure to read the job description and requirements carefully to decide if you’re a good fit for the role.

2. Consider skills and responsibilities: You can also determine whether or not a role is BI-specific by what skills and responsibilities are listed in the job description. Often, data analyst roles are focused on analyzing historical data provided by existing systems. BI roles are usually more focused on developing database systems and delivery processes to provide intelligent access to stakeholders.

3. Research: A large part of your job search is going to be research. When trying to determine whether or not a role is actually BI-related, researching the business that posted the job listing can reveal the kinds of roles that exist within their organization and how they approach data roles in general.

### General tips for job interviews

1. Find connections between the job listing and your resume: First, re-read your resume and the job description to help you draw lines between the two. Where do they connect? Then, as you interview, include specific keywords or phrases from the job description that match skills you possess or achievements you have accomplished previously in your career.

2. Focus on data: As you start to think about things you want to highlight in your interview, don’t forget to include data. This helps your interviewer understand not just your overall achievements, but how big of an impact you made. What data can you provide that tells the story of your experience in terms of the needs of this position? The “equation” we suggest includes something like this: I accomplished X as measured by Y doing Z. Here’s an example: “I increased customer satisfaction by 22% in three months by designing a new digital onboarding process.” If you don’t have access to this kind of data from a previous position, you can still indicate the scope you were accountable for and strengthen the language you use when describing your responsibilities by including action words like provided, created, developed, supported, implemented, and generated. For example: “I implemented a new meeting-scheduling system that saved employees time and improved morale.” 

3. Look back at past work experiences: Review your work history. That may not sound like something you need to prepare for, but most of us have done more than we think and it’s easy to forget some of our own wins (and lessons learned from mistakes). Think of examples of times you achieved something so you are prepared to answer questions like “Tell me about a time when...” or “How would you approach this situation...?" People often diminish or ignore their past job experiences if they don’t immediately apply to the position they’re applying for. However, you bring a lot of transferable skills from past jobs that might be useful—you just have to frame them the right way. For example, you might have gained communication skills from a previous position that can help you connect with stakeholders in a BI role.

4. Come ready with questions: Next, come to the interview with your own questions, such as “What are some upcoming projects I’d be working on? What current goals is the company focused on? Can you tell me about the team I’ll be working with?” This shows you care about understanding the company and the position you’re applying for. Besides, this is your opportunity to interview them as well.

This type of preparation will help you feel confident and prepared to talk about yourself and the position. It will enable you to fully explore your experience, the position, and your career aspirations and really connect with the employer.

- Key takeaways

Job interviews are a necessary part of your job search. As you continue working towards your career as a BI professional, thinking about how you approach the interview process early can ensure that you are prepared for them when the time comes. And being prepared means you can impress potential employers and move forward on your career journey!


## Prepare for interviews with Interview Warmup

Now that you have developed new skills and knowledge in business intelligence, it’s time to start preparing for interviews. 

"Interview Warmup" is a tool that helps you practice answering questions to become more confident and comfortable throughout the interview process. Example interview question: “How would you test integrity of data across various sources?”

- Get started  

Follow these steps to start a five-question practice interview related to BI and data analytics: 

    Go to grow.google/interview-warmup
    Click Start practicing.
    Select Data Analytics to open an additional menu.
    Select Business Intelligence as the field you wish to practice.
    Click Start.

The interview will last about 10 minutes, and the questions will vary with each attempt. During each interview session, you will be asked two background questions, one behavioral question, and two technical questions. You are encouraged to try as many practice interviews as you want.

You can also review complete lists of business intelligence interview questions or general interview questions if you'd like to focus on a particular topic.

- How it works

Interview Warmup asks you interview questions to practice delivering your responses verbally. Your answers will be transcribed in real time, allowing you to review how you responded. In addition, Interview Warmup's machine learning algorithm can detect insights that can help you learn more about your answers and improve the way you communicate.

Here are a few examples of questions the tool might ask:

    How does a career in business intelligence line up with your longer term career goals over the next few years?

    How might your role as a business intelligence analyst impact an organization? What are some of the challenges of using business intelligence?

    How would you test integrity of data across various sources?

    What are some examples of data visualization deliverables? How would you use one of these deliverables?

    Tell me about some of the potential challenges of working with stakeholders. What would you do on a project to prevent or overcome these challenges?

Here are some of the insights that Interview Warmup provides:

    Talking points: The tool lets you know which topics you covered in your answer, such as your experience, skills, and goals. 
    You’ll also be able to view other topics that you might want to consider covering.

    Most-used words: The tool highlights the words you used most often and suggests synonyms to broaden your word choices.

    Job-related terms: The tool highlights the words you used that are related to the role or industry in which you are preparing to work. 
    You’ll also be able to view an entire list of job-related terms that you might want to consider including in your answer.

Interview Warmup gives you the space to practice and prepare for interviews on your own. Your responses will be viewable only by you, and they won’t be graded or judged.

- Key takeaways

Practicing for interviews is an important skill for your career in business intelligence. Using Interview Warmup can help you practice interview questions and receive feedback in real time. As you practice, you will gain confidence and be able to prepare more polished responses for common interview questions.

## Glossary

Business intelligence presentation: A communication with stakeholders about their needs or project status



# Review: DATA ANALYTICS CONTENT

## Presentations

Businesses everywhere know the power of using
data to solve problems and achieve goals.
But all the data in the world won't get
you anywhere if your stakeholders
can't understand it or if
they can't stay focused on what you're telling them.
You want to create
presentations that are logically organized,
interesting, and communicate your key messages clearly.
An effective presentation supports
your narrative by making it
more interesting than words alone.
It starts with how you want to
organize your data insights.
The narrative you share with your stakeholders
needs characters, a setting,
a plot, a big reveal,
and an aha moment just like any other story.
The characters are the people affected by your story.
This could be your stakeholders,
customers, clients, and others.
When adding information about
your characters to your story,
you have a great opportunity to
include a personal account and
bring more human contexts to
the facts that the data has revealed.
Think about why they care.
Next up is a setting which describes what's going on,
how often it's happening,
what tasks are involved,
and other background information about
the data project that describes the current situation.
The plot sometimes called the conflict,
is what creates tension in the current situation.
This can be a challenge from a competitor,
an inefficient process that needs to be fixed,
or a new opportunity that the company just can't pass up.
This complication of the current situation
should reveal the problem
your analysis is solving
and compel the characters to act.
The big reveal or
resolution is how the data has shown that
you can solve the problem the characters are
facing by becoming more competitive,
improving a process, inventing a new system,
or whatever the ultimate goal of
your data project may be.
Finally, your aha moment is when you share
your recommendations and explain
why you think they'll help your company be successful.
When I'm working on a presentation,
this is where I'd like to start too.
Using these basic elements
to outline your presentation can be
a great place to start and they can
help you organize your findings into a clear story.
Once you decided on these five key parts of your story,
it's time to think about how to pair
your narrative with interesting visuals.
Because, as you're learning, an interesting and
persuasive data story needs
interesting and persuasive visuals.
Coming up, you'll learn even more
about how to be an expert data storyteller. 


## Creating a resume

Great, you're back!
When you take a picture,
you usually try to capture lots
of different things in one image.
Maybe you're taking a picture of
the sunset and want to capture the clouds,
the treeline, and the mountains.
Basically, you want a snapshot of that entire moment.
You can think of building your resume in the same way.
You want your resume to be a snapshot of all that
you've done both in school and professionally.
In this video, we'll go through the process of building
a resume, which you will be
able to add your own details to.
Keep in mind this is a snapshot.
When managers and recruiters look
at what you've included in your resume,
they should be able to tell right
away what you can offer their company.
The key here is to be brief.
Try to keep everything in one page and
each description to just a few bullet points.
Two to four bullet points is enough,
but remember to keep your bullet points concise.
Sticking to one page will help you stay
focused on the details that best
reflect who you are or who you want to be professionally.
One page might also be all that
hiring managers and recruiters have time to look at.
They're busy people,
so you want to get their attention with
your resume as quickly as possible.
Now let's talk about actually building your resume.
This is where templates come in.
They're great way to build
a brand new resume or reformat one you already have.
Programs like Microsoft Word or Google Docs and
even some job search websites
all have templates you can use.
A template has placeholders
for the information you'll need to
enter and its own design elements
to make your resume look inviting.
You'll have a chance to explore
this option a little later.
For now, we'll go through the steps you can
take to make your resume professional,
easy to read, and error-free.
If you already have a resume document,
you can use these steps to tweak it.
Now, there's more than one way to build a resume,
but most have contact information
at the top of the document.
This includes your name,
address, phone number, and email address.
If you have multiple email addresses or phone numbers,
use the ones that are most
reliable and sound professional.
It's also great if you can use
your first and last name in
your email address like janedoe17@email.com.
You should also make sure that your contact information
matches the details that you've
included on professional websites.
While most resumes have
contact information in the same place,
it's up to you on how you organize that info.
A format that focuses more on skills
and qualifications, and less on work history
is great for people who have gaps in their work history.
It's also good for those who
are just starting out their career
or making a career change, and that might be you.
If you do want to highlight your work history,
feel free to include details of
your work experience, starting with your most recent job.
If you have lots of jobs that are
related to a new position you're applying for,
this format makes sense.
If you're editing a resume you already have,
you can keep it in the same format
and adjust the details.
If you're starting a new one or
building a resume for the first time,
choose the format that makes the most sense for you.
There's lots of resume resources online.
You should browse through
a bunch of different resumes to get
an idea of the formats you think works best for you.
Once you've decided on your format,
you can start adding your details.
Some resumes begin with the summary,
but this is optional.
A summary can be helpful if you have experienced
that is not traditional for a data analyst,
or if you're making a career transition.
If you decide to include a summary,
keep it to one or two sentences that highlight
your strengths and how
you can help the company you're applying to.
You will also want to make sure
your summary includes positive words about
yourself like "dedicated" and "proactive."
You can support those words with
data like the number of years you've
worked or the tools you're
experienced in, like SQL and spreadsheets.
A summary might start off with something like
"Hard-working customer service representative
with over five years of experience."
Once you've completed this program
and have your certificate,
you'll be able to include that
too, which could sound like this,
"Entry-level data analytics professional; recently
completed the Google Data
Analytics Professional Certificate."
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
Another option is leaving
a place holder for your summary while you build
the rest of your resume, and then
writing it after you finished the other sections.
This way, you can review the skills and experience you've
mentioned and grab two or
three of the highlights to use in your summary.
It's also good to note that summary might change a
little as you apply for different jobs.
If you're including a work experience section,
there's lots of different types
of experience you could add.
Outside of jobs with other companies,
you could also include volunteer positions you've
had and any freelance or side work you've done.
The key here is the way in
which you describe these experiences.
Try to describe the work you did in a way
that relates to the position you're applying for.
Most job descriptions have
minimum qualifications or requirements listed.
These are the experiences, skills,
and education you'll need to be considered for the job.
It's important to clearly state them in your resume.
If you're a good match,
the next step is checking out
preferred qualifications, which lots
of job descriptions also include.
These aren't required, but
every additional qualification you match makes you a more
competitive candidate for the role.
Including any part of your skills and experience
that matches a job description will
help your resume rise above the competition.
If a job listing describes
a job responsibility as,
"effectively managing data resources,"
you'll want to have your own description
that reflects that responsibility.
For example, if you volunteered or
worked at a local school or community center,
you might say that you "effectively manage
resources for after-school activities."
Later on, you'll learn
more ways to make your work history work for you.
It's helpful to describe your skills
and qualifications in the same way.
For example, if a listing talks
about organization and partnering with others,
try to think about relevant experiences you've had.
Maybe you've helped organize a food drive
or partnered with someone to start an online business.
In your descriptions,
you want to highlight the impact you've
had in your role as
well as the impact the role had on you.
If you helped a business get
started or reached new heights,
talk about that experience and
how you played a part in it.
Or if you worked at a store when
it first opened, you can say that you
helped launch a successful business by
ensuring quality customer service.
If you use data analytics and any of
your jobs, you'll definitely want to include that as well.
We'll cover how to add specific data analysis skills
a little bit later.
One way to do this is to
follow a formula in your descriptions,
"accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z."
Here's an example of how this might read on a resume:
"Selected as one of 275 participants nationwide for
this 12-month professional development program for
high-achieving talent based on
leadership potential and academic success."
If you've gained new skills in one of your experiences,
be sure to highlight them all and how they helped.
This is probably as good a spot as
any to bring up data analytics.
Even if this program is
the first time you really thought about data analytics,
now that you're equipped with some knowledge,
you'll want to use that to your benefit.
If you've ever managed money,
maybe that means you helped a business
analyze future earnings,
or maybe you created a budget based
on your analysis of previous spending.
Even if it was for your own
or a friend's small business,
it's still data that you've analyzed.
Now you can reflect on when
and how and use it in your resume.
After you've added work experience and skills,
you should include a section for
any education you've completed.
Yes, this course absolutely counts.
You can add this course as part of your education,
and you can also refer to it in
your Summary and Skills sections.
Depending on the format of your resume,
you might want to add a section
for technical skills you've
acquired, both in this course and elsewhere.
Besides technical skills like SQL,
you could also include
language proficiencies in this section.
Having some ability in a language other than English,
can only help your job search.
Now you have an idea of how to make
your resume look professional and appealing.
As you move forward,
you'll learn even more about
how to make your resume shine.
By the end, you'll have a resume you can be proud of.
Next up, we'll talk about how to make your resume
truly unique. See you soon.
