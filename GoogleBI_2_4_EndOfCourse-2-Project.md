Learning Objectives:

    Identify business needs to determine a design for your portfolio project’s data pipeline.
    Analyze how database systems are designed, how to build BI tools such as pipelines and ETL systems, and how to optimize them to maximize performance to determine the most optimal data pipeline process.
