## Welcome to module 4

Hello! I'm Anita,
Finance Senior Business Intelligence Analyst here at Google.
I'm very happy to be with you as you begin this first video
about your future business intelligence career.
Watching an instructional video – like this one –
or attending a class or reading an article –
are all great ways to gain new knowledge.
However, there's simply nothing
like applying that knowledge.
When you actually do something,
this really helps you confirm
that you understand what you've learned.
This concept is called experiential learning,
which simply means understanding through doing.
It involves immersing yourself in a situation
where you can practice what you've learned,
further develop your skills,
and reflect on your education.
A few years ago, I trained to become a yoga teacher.
It was a bit intimidating at first,
learning all the ins and outs of each pose;
figuring out how to create an effective sequence of poses;
and eventually, leading a yoga studio full of people.
But I paid attention to what worked,
and what I could improve upon during each class.
Then I reflected on that
and revisited many of the lessons
from my training as well.
And with each class I taught,
that learning experience helped me get better and better.
Experiential learning, whether for a hobby or for work,
is always an awesome opportunity.
It gives you a broader view of the world,
provides important insight
into your particular interests and passions,
and helps build self-confidence.
So let's start experiencing
your end-of-course project.
In the context
of this Google Business Intelligence Certificate,
experiential learning will give you the opportunity
to discover how organizations use BI every day.
This type of activity can help you identify
the specific types of industries and projects
that are most interesting to you,
and help you discuss them with potential employers.
This can really help you stand out during a job search.
Soon, you will put experiential learning into practice
by working on an end-of-course project.
As a refresher, a portfolio is a collection of materials
that can be shared with any potential employers.
It's also an amazing way to make your application shine.
Portfolios can be stored on public websites
or your own personal website or blog.
And they can be linked within your digital resume
or any online professional presence you may have,
such as your LinkedIn account.
The project you'll be working on is a BI case study,
which will enable you to bring together
everything you've learned about BI
in a compelling and instructive way.
If you earned your Google Data Analytics Certificate,
you spent a lot of time working on a portfolio
to showcase your knowledge and skills.
This is a great moment to revisit those lessons
in order to ensure that you have the necessary foundations
to create a BI portfolio
that's impactful and impressive.
Or if you didn't complete the program,
you may want to check on that content
before moving forward with this project.
Creating an end-of-course project is a valuable opportunity,
as companies often will ask you
to complete a case study during the interview process.
Employers commonly use this method
to assess you as a candidate
and gain insight into how you approach
common business challenges.
This end-of-course project will help you succeed
if you encounter this situation
when applying for BI jobs.
Coming up, you'll be introduced
to the specific case study
involved in your end-of-course project.
You'll also receive clear instructions to follow
in order to create many BI deliverables.
As you begin working,
you'll consider the knowledge and skills
you've acquired in this course
and how they can be applied to your project.
I encourage you to keep some notes
about your approach,
methods, systems, and accomplishments.
This will help you identify
important points to share with a hiring manager,
such as the many transferable skills you've gained.
A transferable skill is a capability or proficiency
that can be applied from one job to another.
Highlighting your transferable skills
is especially important when changing jobs or industries.
For instance, if you learned
how to solve customer complaints
while working as a host at a restaurant,
you could highlight
the transferable skill of problem-solving
when applying for a job in the BI field.
Or, maybe you learned how to meet deadlines,
take notes, and follow instructions
while working in administration
at a nonprofit organization.
You could discuss how your organizational skills
are transferable to the BI industry.
The point is: if you've developed
the ability to problem-solve
or keep things organized in one role,
you can apply that knowledge anywhere.
There are all kinds of transferable skills
that you can add to your notes document.
Plus, this process will help you consider
how to explain technical concepts clearly
while demonstrating how you would apply your BI expertise
across all kinds of tools and scenarios.
And by the time you're done,
you'll not only have some very useful notes,
but also a finished case study
for your online portfolio.
Sounds exciting, doesn't it?
Let's get going. 



# APPLY YOUR SKILLS TO A WORKPLACE SCENARIO

## Patrick: Be a candidate of choice 

I'm Patrick Lau, I'm a business intelligence manager in Google Legal.
I manage a team of five analysts, and
we work on dashboards, reports, and queries for all of the Google Legal team.
I started at Google in a non-technical role.
I actually started as a legal assistant in the legal department.
I got a lot of opportunities in my first role to work with data because data was
everywhere.
We needed reports to report on data, to visualize data.
And that opportunity gave me a lot of chances to develop my skills and
start presenting data and dashboards.
At Google, I've conducted about 40 interviews all for BI analyst roles.
Usually, what I'm looking for
are candidates who are really strong with their business judgment,
who are able to make a recommendation to find solutions and
leverage data to do that.
As a hiring manager, I see a lot of resumes, and
sometimes they start to look alike.
What I really get excited about though is when a candidate includes a portfolio, and
not a lot of applicants include a portfolio.
What makes me excited about seeing a portfolio is looking beyond just a one
page resume and seeing what kind of work they can do.
The kind of passions they have with data, kind of really just to hear their voice,
that's what really helps me get to know a candidate.
The portfolios that I really like to see aren't just a suite of dashboards.
I actually really like to see a video, maybe on YouTube or
recorded on any other video platform,
because that lets me see a story from beginning to end.
I really enjoy seeing their slides, or seeing them walk through a dashboard,
clicking on different widgets, showing how their trends.
Telling a story like this really helps me get engaged.
I find those kinds of portfolios a lot more interesting than just, hey,
here's a bunch of links, they click on it, they'll look at it yourself.
For candidates creating a portfolio for the first time,
I really recommend keeping it simple.
Assume the hiring manager is only going to spend a few minutes looking through
your dashboard, your reports, or queries.
Think about the message you want them to walk away with.
The actions or recommendations you have should really stand out very quickly and
very clearly.
Don't think too much about impressing a hiring manager.
Really, what's important for me is seeing the recommendation you make,
how you want to influence the business with your data.
As a hiring manager, I would say, I really want everyone to succeed.
I want you to succeed.
You belong in the BI industry.
We need you,
we need more people with unique career paths with unique experiences.
That's how we build a more diverse industry.
That's how we can really increase our skills and innovate.


## Introduction to your end-of-course project

When candidates interview for jobs here at Google,
my colleagues in People Operations
and Human Resources love checking out
their online portfolios.
They often feel more confident
in candidates who can demonstrate their knowledge
in a clear and compelling format.
And when they review portfolios by people who want to join
teams such as mine, in business intelligence,
dashboards are particularly helpful
because they are visually compelling,
but also straightforward and easy to use and understand.
So, together with the hiring managers, we look
for both content and how the dash is organized
and designed to understand how much thought
has been put into the user experience.
Having a portfolio has become extremely common
in the business intelligence field.
During a job hunt,
it is so valuable to showcase your knowledge of BI,
your experience with the BI toolbox,
and some of the interesting projects that you've worked on.
Your portfolio can really help you stand out
from other candidates.
So far in this course, you've gained lots
of knowledge and job-ready skills to help you succeed in BI.
You've discovered the role of BI professionals
within an organization, as well as typical career paths.
You've explored core BI practices and tools –
and witnessed how BI professionals use them
to make a positive impact.
All of these things will help you successfully complete
your end-of-course project.
In addition, you will apply what you've learned
about team members, stakeholders,
and clients, such as their particular roles or priorities.
Along the way,
you'll ensure the metrics you select are relevant
and effective. And you'll apply what you now know
about defining a strategy
and gathering stakeholder and project requirements.
You'll begin by reading about the specific case study.
This reading will explain the type
of organization you're working with, the people involved,
the business problem to be solved, and other key details.
You will complete a Stakeholder Requirements Document,
using information provided by your client.
This will enable you to further define the business problem,
understand the stakeholders,
and consider important questions to answer
in order to achieve a successful result.
Then, you will create a Project Requirements Document,
with information about the project's purpose,
key dependencies, success criteria, and more.
Finally, you will thoughtfully plan your approach
to the example situation,
so you're prepared to develop an effective solution.
As you learned, the Project Requirements Document
includes the project's purpose; its audience;
and key dashboard features and requirements,
including metrics and charts that the dash should contain.
Then in later courses, you will continue working
on your end-of-course project. And by the time you're done,
you will have designed something that you can use
to really, really impress hiring managers.
Plus, you'll have a BI process document
that demonstrates your thought process,
your approach to the business problem,
and the key skills you've gained, and lots more.
These are all great things to talk about
during an interview.
All right, let's get started.
It's time to discover how you will help an organization
advance through the exciting world of business intelligence. 


## End-of-course project introduction

Welcome to the end-of-course project!

Congratulations on your progress in the Google Business Intelligence Certificate! The final module of each course includes an end-of-course project that provides hands-on practice and an opportunity to showcase your BI knowledge. The projects will build in complexity, just like job tasks that you will encounter as a BI professional. After completing all of the courses and projects, you will have a portfolio to share with potential employers.

Importance of communication in the BI career space:

In addition to the technical and organizational skills needed to complete end-of-course projects, you will need to practice effective communication skills. To prepare you, each project will require you to: 

    Gather information about the business problem to be solved or question to be answered

    Complete key BI documents, including the Stakeholder Requirements, Project Requirements, and Strategy documents

    Define team members

    Understand time and budget requirements

    Identify metrics and KPIs

    Know how to measure success

    Highlight your transferable skills

Expectations:

You will be given the tools, resources, and instructions needed to apply your new skills and complete each end-of-course project. You will also have access to thoughtful questions and helpful resources designed to guide and inspire your data analysis workflow. In the end, your effort will be rewarded with work examples that will demonstrate the effectiveness of your BI skills. They will include design patterns; schemas; pipelines; dashboard mockups; data visualizations; and, finally, actual BI dashboards! If you get stuck at any point, you’ll find links to review relevant information within each course.

Your end-of-course project won’t be graded, but you will have access to example deliverables that you can compare to your own work to ensure your project is successful. Unlike other activities, the end-of-course project activities will be less guided to allow you to test your knowledge and practice what you’ve learned. Along the way, you are highly encouraged to participate in the discussion forums to chat with learners working on their own case studies, share strategies, ask questions, and encourage each other! Please note that it’s appropriate to share general project strategies, but not specific steps, processes, or documents. 
Start your project

In your Course 1 end-of-course project you will:

    Review relevant project material from stakeholders to identify key requirements

    Develop project requirement documents to align with stakeholder needs and guide project planning

Key takeaways:

The end-of-course projects enable you to apply your new BI skills and knowledge, demonstrate fundamental BI skills to prospective employers, and showcase what you have learned from the Google Business Intelligence Certificate. Having a portfolio to share during job interviews is a proven way to become a competitive BI candidate. Plus, you are investing lots of time and effort in the program, so completing this project will be a grand celebration of your learning achievements!


## Design effective executive summaries

Business intelligence professionals need ways to share and communicate plans, updates, and summaries about projects. A common document called an executive summary is used to update decision makers who may not be directly involved in the tasks of a project. In your role as a BI professional, you will often be involved in creating executive summaries. 

Additionally, an executive summary can be a useful way to describe your end-of-course project to potential employers. This document can give interviewers exploring your portfolio an easy-to-understand explanation of your projects and be a useful way to reference your projects during the actual interview. 

In this reading, you will learn more about executive summaries and how to prepare them for stakeholders. At the end of your project, you will fill out an executive summary about the work you completed– so it will be useful to start thinking about how to approach that document now. 

### Executive summaries

Executive summaries are documents that collect the most important points contained in a longer plan or report. These summaries are common across a wide variety of businesses, giving decision makers a brief overview of the most relevant information. They can also be used to help new team members become acquainted with the details of a project quickly. The format is designed to respect the responsibilities of decision makers and/or executives who may not have time to read and understand an entire report. There are many ways to present information within an executive summary, including software options built specifically for that purpose. In this program, you will be focusing primarily on a one page format within a presentation slide. Regardless of how they are created, there are some items that are commonly included.

### Elements of an executive summary

The provided sample executive summary deals with an imagined wildfire predictability project. The intended audience of this summary is a group of decision makers from many different departments within teams that service a variety of parks. The purpose of this summary is to share the insights gained through data analysis of wildfires in the US. Each section delivers a short statement without embellishment. This allows decision makers who are often short on time the ability to quickly grasp the most relevant points about a project. Reference this document as you review each of the following sections.

Below you will find a sample executive summary for an imagined project on wildfire predictability. 

- Project title: A project's theme is incorporated into the executive summary title to create an immediate connection with the target audience.

- The problem: A statement that focuses on the need or concern being targeted or addressed by the project. Note, also, that the problem can also be referred to as the hypothesis that you’re trying to prove through analysis. 

- The solution: This statement summarizes a project’s main goal. In this section, actions are described that are intended to address the concerns outlined in the problem statement.

- Details/Key insights: The purpose of this section is to provide any additional background and information that may assist the target audience in understanding the project's objectives. Determining what details to include depends heavily on the intended audience. It may also be the case that you choose to include some project reflections. 

Key takeaways:

Executive summaries are important ways to share information with decision makers, clients, and executives. These documents include a summarized version of the most important information within a project or plan of action. The executive summary is usually broader in scope, not focusing on specific responsibilities or tasks. The executive summary summarizes the status of a project and its discoveries, describing a problem and proposing a solution.


## Explore Course 1 end-of-course project scenarios

When you approach a project using structured thinking, you will often find that there are specific steps you need to complete in a specific order. The end-of-course projects in the Google Business Intelligence certificate were designed with this in mind. The challenges presented in each course represent a single milestone within an entire project, based on the skills and concepts learned in that course. 

The certificate program allows you to choose from different workplace scenarios to complete the end-of-course projects: the Cyclistic bike share company or Google Fiber. Each scenario offers you an opportunity to refine your skills and create artifacts to share on the job market in an online portfolio. 

You will be practicing similar skills regardless of which scenario you choose, but you must complete at least one end-of-course project for each course to earn your Google Business Intelligence certificate. To have a cohesive experience, it is recommended that you choose the same scenario for each end-of-course project. For example, if you choose the Cyclistic scenario to complete in Course 1, we recommend completing this same scenario in Course 2 and 3 as well. However, if you are interested in more than one workplace scenario or would like more of a challenge, you are welcome to do more than one end-of-course project. Completing multiple projects offers you additional practice and examples you can share with prospective employers.

Course 1 end-of-course project scenarios: 

### Cyclistic bike-share

Background: 

In this fictitious workplace scenario, the imaginary company Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel among stations at these locations. 

Scenario:

You are a newly hired BI professional at Cyclistic. The company’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. They want to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

Course 1 challenge:

    Gather information from notes taken at the last Cyclistic executive meeting 
    Identify relevant stakeholders for each task
    Organize tasks into milestones
    Complete project planning documents in order to align with stakeholders

Note: The story, as well as all names, characters, and incidents portrayed, are fictitious. No identification with actual people (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. The data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.

### Google Fiber


Background: 

Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. Currently, the customer service team working in their call centers answers calls from customers in their established service areas. In this fictional scenario, the team is interested in exploring trends in repeat calls to reduce the number of times customers have to call in order for an issue to be resolved. 

Scenario:

You are currently interviewing for a BI position on the Google Fiber call center team. As part of the interview process, they ask you to develop a dashboard tool that allows them to explore trends in repeat calls. The team needs to understand how often customers call customer support after their first inquiry. This will help leadership understand how effectively the team can answer customer questions the first time.

Course 1 challenge:

    Gather information from notes taken during your interview with Google Fiber
    Identify relevant stakeholders for each task
    Organize tasks into milestones
    Complete project planning documents in order to align with stakeholders

Key Takeaways:

In Course 1, Foundations of Business intelligence, you explored the world of BI professionals and learned how BI contributes to an organization's vision.

Course 1 skills:

    Practice effective communication
    Understand cross-functional team dynamics
    Perform effective project management
    Share insights and ideas with stakeholders

Course 1 end-of-course project deliverables: Three BI project planning documents.

You will have the opportunity to explore the scenarios in more detail coming up in the workplace scenario overview readings. Once you have read the overviews, choose which workplace scenario is most interesting to you!


# CYCLISTIC SCENARIO

Welcome to Cyclistic! 

Congrats on your new job with the business intelligence team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in New York City. In order to provide your team with both BI business value and organizational data maturity, you will use your knowledge of the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor. By the time you are done, you will have an end-of-course project that demonstrates your knowledge and skills to potential employers.

- Your meeting notes:

You recently attended a meeting with key stakeholders to gather details about this BI project. The following details are your notes from the meeting. Use the information they contain to complete the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirements Document, and Planning Document. For additional guidance, refer to the  previous reading about the documents and the  self-review that involved completing them.

Project background:

    Primary dataset: NYC Citi Bike Trips
    Secondary dataset: Census Bureau US Boundaries

Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

Cyclistic has captured data points for every trip taken by their customers, including:

    Trip start time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)
    Trip end time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)
    The rented bike’s identification number
    The type of customer (either a one-time customer, or a subscriber)

The dataset includes millions of rides, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key insights. Business plans that are driven by customer insights are more successful than plans driven by just internal staff observations. The executive summary must include key data points that are summarized and aggregated in order for the leadership team to get a clear vision of how customers are using Cyclistic.

Stakeholders: 

    Sara Romero, VP, Marketing
    Ernest Cox, VP,  Product Development
    Jamal Harris, Director, Customer Data
    Nina Locklear, Director, Procurement

Team members: 

    Adhira Patel, API Strategist
    Megan Pirato, Data Warehousing Specialist
    Rick Andersson, Manager, Data Governance 
    Tessa Blackwell, Data Analyst
    Brianne Sand, Director, IT
    Shareefah Hakimi, Project Manager

    * Primary contacts are Adhira, Megan, Rick, and Tessa. 

    * Per Sara: Dashboard needs to be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.

Project approvals and dependencies:

The datasets will include customer (user) data, which Jamal will need to approve. Also the project might need approval by the teams that own specific product data, including bike trip duration and bike identification numbers. So I need to make sure that stakeholders have data access to all datasets.

Project goal: Grow Cyclistic’s Customer Base.

Details from Ms. Romero:

- Understand what customers want, what makes a successful product, and how new stations might alleviate demand in different geographical areas.

- Understand how the current line of bikes are used.

- How can we apply customer usage insights to inform new station growth?

- The customer growth team wants to understand how different users (subscribers and non-subscribers) use our bikes. We’ll want to investigate a large group of users to get a fair representation of users across locations and with low- to high-activity levels.

- Keep in mind users might use Cyclistic less when the weather is inclement. This should be visible in the dashboard.

The deliverables and metrics:

- A table or map visualization exploring starting and ending station locations, aggregated by location.

      I can use any location identifier, such as station, zip code, neighborhood, and/or borough. This should show the number of trips at starting locations.

      Tip: You can show either a table or a map. For more about creating maps in Tableau, check out the  Build a simple map guide on Tableau Help.

      For a table, you could include just starting locations or a combination of starting and ending locations. 

- A visualization showing which destination (ending) locations are popular based on the total trip minutes.

      Tip: Focus on peak months.

- A visualization that focuses on trends from the summer of 2015.

- A visualization showing the percent growth in the number of trips year over year.

- Gather insights about congestion at stations.

        Tip: For each day, use a table calculation to calculate the net of start and ending trips per station. This gives an approximation of whether there are more bikes coming in or out of a station.

- Gather insights about the number of trips across all starting and ending locations.

- Gather insights about peak usage by time of day, season, and the impact of weather.

Dashboard must be created in 6 weeks!

Measure success:

Analyze data that spans at least one year to see how seasonality affects usage. Exploring data that spans multiple months will capture peaks and valleys in usage. Evaluate each trip on the number of rides per starting location and per day/month/year to understand trends. For example, do customers use Cyclistic less when it rains? Or does bikeshare demand stay consistent? Does this vary by location and user types (subscribers vs. nonsubscribers)? Use these outcomes to find out more about what impacts customer demand.

Other considerations:

The dataset includes latitude and longitude of stations but does not identify more geographic aggregation details, such as zip code, neighborhood name, or borough. The team will provide a separate database with this data. 

The weather data provided does not include what time precipitation occurred; it’s possible that on some days, it precipitated during off-peak hours. However, for the purpose of this dashboard, I should assume any amount of precipitation that occurred on the day of the trip could have an impact.

Starting bike trips at a location will be impossible if there are no bikes available at a station, so we might need to consider other factors for demand.

Finally, the data must not include any personal info (name, email, phone, address). Personal info is not necessary for this project. Anonymize users to avoid bias and protect their privacy. 

People with dashboard-viewing privileges: 
    
    Adhira, Brianne, Ernest, Jamal, Megan, Nina, Rick, Shareefah, Sara, Tessa

Roll-out:

    Week 1: Dataset assigned. Initial design for fields and BikeIDs validated to fit the requirements.
    Weeks 2–3: SQL and ETL development
    Weeks 3–4: Finalize SQL. Dashboard design. 1st draft review with peers.
    Weeks 5–6: Dashboard development and testing

Questions:

    How were bikes used by our customers?
    How can we apply insights from the data generated by trip data?

Next steps:

As you use these notes to complete the key BI documents, take time to consider:

    How to organize the various points and steps
    How to group similar topics
    Whether the information is relevant to the project
    Whether the metrics are effective or not

Lastly, keep in mind that this project is not graded. However, a compelling project will enable you to demonstrate fundamental BI skills to prospective employers. After you complete the documents, be sure to compare them to the example deliverables. You might also record the steps you took to complete each phase of this project so that you can complete the executive summary. This will be important as you continue working on the project in subsequent courses. 


# GOOGLE FIBER SCENARIO

Welcome to Google Fiber! 

You are interviewing for a job with Google Fiber, which provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. As part of the interview process, the Fiber customer service team has asked you to design a dashboard using fictional data. The position you are interviewing for is in the customer call center, where Fiber uses business intelligence to monitor and improve customer satisfaction.

To provide the interviewers with both BI value and organizational data maturity, you will use your knowledge of the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor. By the time you are done, you will have an end-of-course project that demonstrates your knowledge and skills to potential employers.

Your meeting notes:

You are interviewing with the Google Fiber customer service team for a position as a BI analyst. At the end of the first interview, you spoke with the BI team and hiring manager to gather details about this project. Following are your notes from the meeting. Use the information they contain to complete the Stakeholder Requirements Document, Project Requirements Document, and Planning Document. For additional guidance, refer to the previous reading about key BI documents and the self-review about completing the documents.

Project background:

The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers. 

This fictional dataset is a version of actual data the team works with. Because of this, the data is already anonymized and approved. It includes:

    Number of calls
    Number of repeat calls after first contact
    Call type
    Market city
    Date

Stakeholders: 

    Emma Santiago, Hiring Manager
    Keith Portone, Project Manager
    Minna Rah, Lead BI Analyst

Team members: 

    Ian Ortega, BI Analyst
    Sylvie Essa, BI Analyst
    
    * Primary contacts are Emma and Keith
    
    Per Minna: Dashboard needs to be accessible, with large print and text-to-speech alternatives.

Project approvals and dependencies: I need to make sure stakeholders have access to all datasets so they can explore the steps I’ve taken.

Project goal: Explore trends in repeat callers

Details from Mr. Portone:

    Understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time
    Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls
    Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities
    Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year 

The deliverables and metrics:

    A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date
    A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type
    Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter

Measure success:

The team’s ultimate goal is to reduce call volume by increasing customer satisfaction and improving operational optimization. My dashboard should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. 

Other considerations:

In order to anonymize and fictionalize the data, the datasets the columns market_1, market_2, and market_3 to indicate three different city service areas the data represents. 

The data also lists five problem types:

    Type_1 is account management
    Type_2 is technician troubleshooting
    Type_3 is scheduling
    Type_4 is construction
    Type_5 is internet and wifi

Additionally, the dataset records repeat calls over seven-day periods. The initial contact date is listed as contacts_n. The other call columns are then contacts_n_number of days since first call. For example, contacts_n_6 indicates six days since first contact. 

People with dashboard-viewing privileges: Emma Santiago, Keith Portone, Minna Rah, Ian Ortega, Sylvie Essa.

Questions:

    How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers?
    What problem types generate the most repeat calls?
    Which market city’s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?

Next steps:

As you use these notes to complete the key BI documents, take time to consider:

    How to organize the various points and steps
    How to group similar topics
    Whether the information is relevant to the project
    Whether the metrics are effective

Lastly, keep in mind that this project is not graded. However, a compelling project will enable you to demonstrate fundamental BI skills to prospective employers. After you complete the documents, be sure to compare them to the example deliverables. You might also record the steps you took to complete each phase of this project so that you can complete the executive summary. This will be important as you continue working on the project in subsequent courses.


# REVIEW THE PROJECT

## End-of-course project review

You've completed the first part
of the business intelligence end-of-course project.
Congratulations!
Planning and documenting
your approach to the example situation
is a valuable experience
as you begin thinking about your future job hunt.
Soon, you'll be able to impress hiring managers
by discussing your BI experience,
including understanding stakeholder requests,
establishing a clear and straightforward project plan,
and completing an effective strategy document.
In addition, you'll understand
how to share everything you know about
identifying relevant metrics and KPIs.
This is a big part of the BI process.
Also, as you've learned, it's super helpful to communicate
about your transferable skills with potential employers.
The information you've added to your BI notes
will be extremely useful during job interviews.
The following step in your end-of-course project
will come at the end of the next course.
At that point, you will use the assets you developed here
in order to continue creating your solution.
Then, at the end of the program,
you'll bring everything together in order to finalize
your unique approach to this example situation.
Keep in mind: Your documents
won't look exactly like the exemplar,
but they should achieve the same goals.
You're always welcome to go back
and review what you created so you're set up for success
as you continue through this program.
The goal is to have a great example of your work
that clearly demonstrates to potential employers
just how skilled you are.
Congratulations again!
And I hope you have a rewarding experience
as you work on the project throughout this program. 


## Step by step

### Step 1: Open your notes

Open your meeting notes from the reading that details the Course 1 workplace scenario overview about Google Fiber and keep them open in another window so you can refer to them while completing the three key BI documents.

Pro Tip: Use all available resources. A big part of being a BI professional is researching solutions, troubleshooting, and knowing where to go for support. For this activity, it is highly recommended that you refer to the previous reading about the key business intelligence documents and activity about completing the documents for additional guidance.

### Step 2: Access the templates

Stakeholder Requirements Document

Project Requirement Document

Strategy Document


### Step 3: Complete the Stakeholder Requirements Document

Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the project requirements document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.

The Stakeholder Requirements Document enables you to capture stakeholder requests and requirements so you understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy. It should answer the following questions:

    Business problem: What is the primary question to be answered or problem to be solved?

    Stakeholders: Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles? 

    Stakeholder usage details: How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?

    Primary requirements: What requirements must be met by this BI tool in order for this project to be successful? 

Here are some questions BI professionals ask to successfully complete this document:

    What questions must be answered before starting this project? 

    What does the BI team need to know before starting this project? 

    What are the questions that must be answered or problems that must be solved by this project?

    What datasets are considered important to this project?

    Who should have access to the dashboard? Will the entire dashboard be visible to all stakeholders?

Typically, the Stakeholder Requirements Document is a one-pager with notes, but it can be longer and more detailed for complex projects.

### Step 4: Complete the Project Requirements Document

Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the project requirements document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.

The Project Requirements Document contains the following details:

    Purpose: Briefly describe why this project is happening and explain why the company should invest its resources in it.

    Key dependencies: Detail the major elements of this project. Include the team, primary contacts, and expected deliverables. Are there any inter-team deliverables required? 

    Stakeholder requirements: List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.

    Success criteria: Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria. 

    User journeys: Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience. 

    Assumptions: Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making. 

    Compliance and privacy: Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider. 

    Accessibility: List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users. Who needs to access this feature? How are they viewing and interacting with it? 

    Roll-out plan: Briefly describe the expected scope, priorities and timeline. Consider at what points during the rollout will measurements be made to determine whether the feature is performing as expected? Is there a rollback plan and timeline if this feature does not meet its intended goals?

### Step 5: Complete the Strategy Document

Use your meeting notes to fill out as much of the strategy document template as you can. If you find that there are some fields that you can’t fill out, make note of them for later in the exercise.

The Strategy Document is a collaborative place to align with stakeholders about project deliverables. You will establish information about dashboard functionality and associated metrics and charts for this project.

This is a time to explore what metrics will be required, how metrics are calculated, and any limitations or assumptions that exist about the data. Stakeholders think through these details and help the BI professional make final project decisions. Then, the BI professional provides stakeholders with a dashboard mockup to get useful feedback. 

Generally, the BI professional will create the document, then request review and sign-off from stakeholders. Then, they can begin working on the project with all of the details they need. 

### Step 6: Write follow-up questions for your stakeholder

By now, you’ve filled out each of the templates with information from the interview. But you might have noticed that you’re missing some information for fields in the template. In a professional setting, you might need to ask a stakeholder follow-up questions to properly complete planning documents.

Write 3-5 questions about information that is missing from the interview notes. In a professional setting, you could ask these questions to your stakeholder to help you fully complete your documents.
